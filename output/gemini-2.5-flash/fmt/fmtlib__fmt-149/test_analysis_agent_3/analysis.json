Please modify the evaluation script to perform the following steps after `make test` completes and its exit code (`rc`) indicates a failure:\n1. Identify the full paths to the failing test executables, which are `/testbed/build/bin/format-test` and `/testbed/build/bin/util-test`.\n2. For each of these failing executables, run them under `gdb`.\n3. Inside `gdb`, execute the `run` command to start the test.\n4. When the test crashes (segfaults), execute the `bt full` command to get a full backtrace with arguments and local variables.\n5. Capture this `gdb` output for analysis. Ensure the `gdb` commands do not prematurely exit the script by using `|| true` if necessary.\n\nExample snippet to add after `rc=$?` and `if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then`:\n\n```bash\nif [ \"$rc\" -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Tests failed.
