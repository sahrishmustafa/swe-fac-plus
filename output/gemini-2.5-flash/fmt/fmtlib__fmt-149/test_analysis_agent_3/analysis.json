  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The 'util-test' executable crashed with a SegFault, preventing successful test completion. To obtain more detailed diagnostic information (a backtrace), modify the eval script to run the test executable directly using 'gdb'. Replace the current `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -R util-test` command with a GDB command to capture the backtrace. The test executable is located at `/testbed/build/bin/util-test`. Additionally, remember to capture the exit code of the *executed program* or GDB and ensure 'OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc' is correctly reported. Example GDB command to get a backtrace on crash:\n\n```bash\nset +e # Allow the script to continue even if gdb returns an error\necho \"--- Capturing GDB backtrace for util-test ---\"\n/usr/bin/gdb -ex \"set pagination off\" -ex \"run\" -ex \"thread apply all bt full\" -ex \"quit\" --batch --args /testbed/build/bin/util-test\nrc=$? # Capture GDB's exit code, which usually indicates whether the program crashed.\n\n# Although CTest wasn't used for a detailed backtrace, its return code 8 (-R util-test with SegFault) is still relevant for 'failed' status.\n# For now, let the overall script exit code reflect the GDB result, or combine it with CTest if it were still run.\n# Given a SegFault, any `rc` other than 0 from GDB indicates failure.\n/usr/bin/gdb -ex \"set pagination off\" -ex \"run\" -ex \"thread apply all bt full\" -ex \"quit\" --batch --args /testbed/build/bin/util-test\nrc=$? # Capture GDB's exit code (0 if successful, non-zero if program crashed or gdb error occurred)\nOMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc # Report GDB's exit status\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could run the CTest command as before, and if it fails (exit code 8), then run the gdb command.",
