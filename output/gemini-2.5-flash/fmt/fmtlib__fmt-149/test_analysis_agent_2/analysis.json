While the Dockerfile successfully sets up the environment and the project builds initially, the segmentation fault occurs after the patch is applied and the project is rebuilt. The patch adds a very simple test case, suggesting the issue is likely not directly with the added test code, but rather with the recompilation and relinking process or a subtle ABI incompatibility.\n\nTo address this, modify the evaluation script to perform a full clean rebuild after applying the patch. This ensures that all necessary components, including the `fmt` library and its test executables, are rebuilt from a clean state, mitigating potential issues from incremental builds or stale artifacts.\n\n**Specific changes for eval script:**\n1.  After applying the patch (`git apply -v - <<'EOF_...'`), navigate back to the root of the repository (`cd /testbed`).\n2.  Remove the existing `build` directory (`rm -rf build`).\n3.  Recreate the `build` directory (`mkdir build`).\n4.  Navigate into the `build` directory (`cd build`).\n5.  Rerun `cmake` with the same configuration (`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_EXTRA_TESTS=ON ..`).\n6.  Rerun `make -j$(nproc)` to perform a complete fresh build.\n\nThis sequence will ensure that the `util-test` executable and any dependencies are built against the patched source files from scratch, which should resolve the segfault if it was caused by an inconsistent build state.",
