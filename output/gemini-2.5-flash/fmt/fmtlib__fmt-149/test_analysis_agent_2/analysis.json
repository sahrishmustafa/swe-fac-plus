  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The `util-test` (and `format-test`) experienced a Segmentation Fault (SegFault) during execution. While the test ran to the point of failure, diagnosing such an issue requires detailed debugging information. The current Dockerfile builds the project with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, which typically strips debug symbols, making it challenging to get meaningful stack traces from the segfault. Modify the `cmake` command in the Dockerfile to use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` instead of `Release`. This will include debug symbols in the compiled executables, which is crucial for effective diagnosis of segfaults. Example change: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DFMT_EXTRA_TESTS=ON ..`",
