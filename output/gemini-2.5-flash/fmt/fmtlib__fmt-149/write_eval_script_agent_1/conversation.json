Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):\n    *   Base OS: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian is suitable given the Travis CI configuration).\n    *   Required Tools/Dependencies:\n        *   `build-essential` (includes C++ compiler like GCC/G++, and `make`).\n        *   `cmake` (version >= 2.6, readily available in standard apt repositories).\n        *   `git` (for handling submodules).\n    *   Language/Runtime: C++11 (handled by modern GCC/Clang from `build-essential`).\n    *   Special Considerations:\n        *   The project uses Git submodules (specifically for `gmock`), which must be initialized after cloning.\n        *   A separate build directory is customary and recommended.\n\n2. Test Execution (for Evaluation Script):\n    *   Build System: CMake + Make.\n    *   Test Framework: CTest (which orchestrates Google Test).\n    *   Build & Test Commands:\n        1.  `git submodule update --init` (from the repository root).\n        2.  `mkdir build && cd build` (creates and enters the build directory).\n        3.  `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_EXTRA_TESTS=ON ..` (configures the project).\n        4.  `make -j \"$(nproc)\"` (compiles the project, including test executables).\n        5.  `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test` (executes all compiled tests, including those from `test/util-test.cc`).\n    *   Specific Test Files: The target `test/util-test.cc` is compiled into a test executable and is run as part of the general `make test` command via CTest. There's no direct command to run only `util-test.cc` as a source file; rather, the compiled test binary resulting from it is executed by CTest.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''. This ensures the judge can determine whether the tests passed successfully.\n\nEval script skeleton:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -uxo pipefail\ncd /testbed\ngit checkout 88f4be3d19364a484431309f750535386c7d0d5c \"test/util-test.cc\"\ngit apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\ngit checkout 88f4be3d19364a484431309f750535386c7d0d5c \"test/util-test.cc\"\n\n\n### **Example Format:**\nThe script must be wrapped in `<script>` tags.
