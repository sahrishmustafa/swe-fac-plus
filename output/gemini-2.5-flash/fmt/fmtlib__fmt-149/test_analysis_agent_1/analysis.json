This indicates a problem within the compiled code or a subtle environmental incompatibility. The current Dockerfile and eval script successfully built and ran the tests. To diagnose the root cause of the segmentation fault, please retrieve more context about the specific build requirements for the fmtlib/fmt repository at commit 88f4be3d19364a484431309f750535386c7d0d5c. Specifically look for information in files like `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CMakeLists.txt`, or CI/CD configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows`) that might specify:\n1. The required or recommended C++ standard (e.g., C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20).\n2. Specific compatible C++ compiler versions (e.g., GCC, Clang) or minimum versions.\n3. Any unusual or critical CMake flags/definitions beyond standard Release configuration that are necessary for a stable build or test execution.",
