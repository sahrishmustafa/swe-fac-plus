This indicates a critical runtime error in the test code itself, likely introduced or exacerbated by the applied patch. The evaluation script correctly invoked `ctest` and the test executable was found and started. However, it crashed almost immediately. You need to revise the content of the test patch (`[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]`) for `test/util-test.cc` to fix the underlying segfault. Ensure the patch makes correct changes and doesn't introduce memory errors or undefined behavior. If the patch intends to add a new test, ensure its implementation is robust and correct.",
