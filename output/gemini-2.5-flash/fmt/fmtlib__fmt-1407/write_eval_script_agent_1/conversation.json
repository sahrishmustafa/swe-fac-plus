Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4.

Operating System Base: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian derived, given apt and Travis dist: trusty). A recent Ubuntu LTS version (e.g., 20.04 or 22.04 LTS) is suitable.\n5.  Required Tools/Packages:\n    *   C++ Compiler: g++ (supporting C++14/C++17 features). A modern version like g++-9 or g++-11 would suffice.\n    *   Build Tools: cmake (version >= 3.1.0) and make.\n    *   Other: git (for cloning, although the repository is pre-cloned).\n6.  Environment Variables for Build/Test:\n    *   CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 is recommended during test execution for detailed output.\n    *   CMake configuration relies on CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (setting to Release is a good default) and CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD (setting to 14, or 17 for more modern features, but 14 is explicitly supported and sufficient).\n7.  Build Process Steps:\n    *   Create a build directory (e.g., mkdir build && cd build).\n    *   Configure CMake: cmake -DFMT_DOC=OFF -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 .. (from inside the build directory, pointing to the parent source directory).\n    *   Build: cmake --build . (or make -j $(nproc)).\n8.  Test Execution Steps:\n    *   Tests are run from the build directory.\n    *   The command is CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test.\n    *   The specific test files (test/core-test.cc, test/format-test.cc) are implicitly run as part of the overall make test target, as indicated by test/CMakeLists.txt being included and enable_testing() being used. CTest will discover and run all tests defined.\n\n"

Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7.
