To resolve this, the computationally intensive build step should be moved out of the Dockerfile `RUN` instruction and into the evaluation script. The Dockerfile should only configure the build system. Modify the last `RUN` instruction in the Dockerfile to remove `&& cmake --build .`. The updated instruction should look like this:\n`RUN mkdir build && \\\n    cd build && \\\n    cmake -G Ninja -DFMT_DOC=OFF -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 ..`",
