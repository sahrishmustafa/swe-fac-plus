This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

If yes, please give a summary of the collected information.\nYes, I have collected enough information to write a Dockerfile and an evaluation script.\n\n**Summary of Collected Information:**\n\n**1. Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):**\n    *   **Operating System:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).\n    *   **Core Tools/Dependencies:**\n        *   C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).\n        *   CMake (version 3.1 - 3.18, aiming for a recent stable version like 3.13+ or even newer for better compatibility).\n        *   `git` (though the repository is already cloned).\n    *   **C++ Standard:** C++11 is explicitly required, and C++14 is implied. I will configure the compiler to support C++17, as it is modern and backward compatible for this use case.\n\n**2. Building the Project (for Dockerfile and Evaluation Script):**\n    *   The project uses CMake for its build system.\n    *   The standard build process involves:\n        1.  Creating a build directory: `mkdir build`\n        2.  Navigating into the build directory: `cd build`\n        3.  Configuring CMake: `cmake ..` (or `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`)\n        4.  Compiling the project: `cmake --build .` (or `make`)\n\n**3. Running Tests (for Evaluation Script):**\n    *   **Test Framework:** CTest (integrated with CMake).\n    *   **Target Test File:** `test/ranges-test.cc`.\n    *   **Corresponding CTest Test Name:** `ranges-test`.\n    *   **Command to run this specific test (from the build directory):** `ctest -R \"ranges-test\"`.\n    *   Alternatively, building the `test` target would run all tests: `cmake --build . --target test`.
