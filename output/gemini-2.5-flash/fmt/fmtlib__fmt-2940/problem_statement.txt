tuple-formatter doesn't check that the tuple-elements are formattable.
tuple-formatter doesn't check that the tuple-elements are formattable:
https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/include/fmt/ranges.h#L285-L287

which makes `is_formattable<std::tuple<T>>::value` true:

even when the `T` is not formattable, and trying to format `std::tuple<T>` will lead to a hard error.
