Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4.

Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):\n    *   Operating System: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).\n    *   Core Tools/Dependencies:\n        *   C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).\n        *   CMake (version 3.1 - 3.18, aiming for a recent stable version like 3.13+ or even newer for better compatibility).\n        *   `git` (though the repository is already cloned).\n    *   C++ Standard: C++11 is explicitly required, and C++14 is implied. I will configure the compiler to support C++17, as it is modern and backward compatible for this use case.\n\n2. Building the Project (for Dockerfile and Evaluation Script):\n    *   The project uses CMake for its build system.\n    *   The standard build process involves:\n        1.  Creating a build directory: `mkdir build`\n        2.  Navigating into the build directory: `cd build`\n        3.  Configuring CMake: `cmake ..` (or `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`)\n        4.  Compiling the project: `cmake --build .` (or `make`)\n\n3. Running Tests (for Evaluation Script):\n    *   Test Framework: CTest (integrated with CMake).\n    *   Target Test File: `test/ranges-test.cc`.\n    *   Corresponding CTest Test Name: `ranges-test`.\n    *   Command to run this specific test (from the build directory): `ctest -R \"ranges-test\"`.\n    *   Alternatively, building the `test` target would run all tests: `cmake --build . --target test`. However, `ctest -R \"ranges-test\"` is preferred for running only the specified test.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''.
