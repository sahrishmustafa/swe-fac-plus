This typically indicates an out-of-memory or out-of-resources issue during the build process. \n\nTo fix this:\n1. Modify the `cmake ..` call in the Dockerfile to explicitly disable building tests during the environment setup. Tests should only be built and run by the evaluation script.\n2. Reduce the number of parallel compilation jobs in the Dockerfile's `cmake --build` command to conserve memory and CPU resources during the Dockerfile build process.\n\nRevised Dockerfile relevant section:\n```dockerfile\nRUN git clone https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt /testbed && \\\n    cd /testbed && \\\n    git reset --hard eaa8efb950be5d8f1803a99b06f76cf398c67cb8 && \\\n    git remote remove origin && \\\n    mkdir build && \\\n    cd build && \\\n    cmake .. -DFMT_TEST=OFF && \\  # Added -DFMT_TEST=OFF to prevent tests from being built in Dockerfile\n    cmake --build . -j1  # Changed -j$(nproc) to -j1 to reduce resource consumption during initial build\n```\nThis change ensures the Dockerfile only builds the core library and is less prone to OOM errors, leaving the test compilation to the evaluation script.",
