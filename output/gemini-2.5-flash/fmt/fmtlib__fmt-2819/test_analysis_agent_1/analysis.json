Consequently, the tests were not executed.\nTo resolve this, modify the `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` command in the eval script to use fewer parallel jobs. The current `j$(nproc)` might be too aggressive for the container's available memory.\nChange `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` to `cmake --build . -j4` (or even a lower number like `-j2` as a fallback) to reduce memory pressure during compilation. This limits the number of concurrent compilation processes and should prevent the OOM error.",
