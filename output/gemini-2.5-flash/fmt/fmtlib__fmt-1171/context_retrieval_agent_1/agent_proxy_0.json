This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

Given that it's a C++ project with `CMakeLists.txt`, CMake will be central to the build and test process. I'll also check `README.rst` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for general build instructions and dependencies. Finally, the `.travis.yml` file is crucial for understanding how the project is built and tested in a CI environment, which often reflects the most reliable setup.\n\nHere's my plan of action:\n\n1.  **Browse `README.rst` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: These files typically contain high-level instructions for setting up the environment and building the project.\n2.  **Browse `CMakeLists.txt` (root)**: This file defines the overall build process, required CMake version, and any external dependencies. It should also indicate how tests are added.\n3.  **Browse `.travis.yml`**: This file will show the exact commands used by the CI system to build and run tests, including compiler versions, prerequisites, and test commands (`ctest` is common for CMake projects).\n\nAfter gathering this information, I should be able to deduce the necessary Dockerfile configuration (base image, packages) and the commands for the evaluation script.\n\nI will use the following API calls:\n\n1.  `browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path='README.rst', custom_query='How to build and run tests, required dependencies, CMake version.')`\n2.  `browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path='CONTRIBUTING.md', custom_query='Build instructions, testing, development setup.')`\n3.  `browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path='CMakeLists.txt', custom_query='CMake version, dependencies, how tests are defined and linked.')`\n4.  `browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path='.travis.yml', custom_query='Build steps, test commands, required compilers and tools.')`</analysis>"
