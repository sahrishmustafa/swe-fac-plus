This typically indicates an Out Of Memory (OOM) issue during compilation when too many parallel jobs are run. To fix this, reduce the number of parallel jobs for the `make` command. Change `make -j$(nproc)` to `make -j1` or `make -j2` (preferably `make -j1` for maximum stability) in the Dockerfile's last `RUN` command. This will limit resource consumption during the build.",
