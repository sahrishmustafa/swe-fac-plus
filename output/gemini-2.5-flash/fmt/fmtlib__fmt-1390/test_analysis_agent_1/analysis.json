This typically indicates an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error where the compiler exceeds the available memory resources. To mitigate this, modify the 'cmake --build .' command in the evaluation script to limit the number of parallel compilation jobs. This will reduce the peak memory consumption during the build.\n\nSpecifically, update the build command from:\n`cmake --build .`\nto something like:\n`cmake --build . -j2` (or -j1 to be very safe, or -jN where N is a suitable small number based on expected CPU/memory configuration for the container).\n\nThis change should be applied immediately after the 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -GNinja ..' command, within the 'build' directory.",
