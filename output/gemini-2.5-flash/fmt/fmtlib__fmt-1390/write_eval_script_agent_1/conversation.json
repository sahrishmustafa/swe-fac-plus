Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4.

Base Operating System: Ubuntu (specifically 18.04, implied by typical Travis CI images for the mentioned packages and versions).\n2.  C++ Standard: C++14 is required.\n3.  Compiler: `g++-8` is a suitable choice, as it's listed in `.travis.yml` and supports C++14.\n4.  Core Build Tools: `build-essential` (for `gcc`, `g++`, `make`), `cmake` (minimum 3.1.0), and `ninja-build` are required system packages. These are typically installed via `apt`.\n5.  No other specific language runtimes or package managers (like Python/pip, Node.js/npm, Java/Maven/Gradle) are needed for core C++ compilation and testing of this library.\n\nFor Evaluation Script (Test Execution):\n1.  Test Framework: CTest is used for running tests.\n2.  Build Process:\n    *   Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build && cd build`).\n    *   Configure CMake with Ninja generator and Release build type: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -GNinja ..`.\n    *   Build the project: `cmake --build .` (or `ninja -j$(nproc)`).\n3.  Test Execution Command: After building, tests are executed using: `ctest --output-on-failure`. The target test file `test/format-test.cc` will automatically be included and executed as part of the `ctest` suite, as indicated by `CMakeLists.txt` enabling testing and `test/CMakeLists.txt` defining tests within the `test/` directory.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7.
