Ambiguous partial specialization when formatting boost `flat_set` since fmt v10.0.0
When trying to format a `flat_set` from boost, an ambiguous lookup for `formatter` happens.

Reproducer:
https://godbolt.org/z/dhqnMf755
boost version 1.82.0 (changing it to some random previous versions did not change something) 
Clang 16.0.0 with fmt trunk
gcc 13.2 with fmt trunk
gcc 13.2 with fmt 9.1.0 as a proof it worked with fmt 9.1.0

The ambiguous formatters are in lines
https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/757564f5cd2fa78b634dd698c63dbf069818e6fd/include/fmt/ranges.h#L560
and
https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/757564f5cd2fa78b634dd698c63dbf069818e6fd/include/fmt/ranges.h#L671
