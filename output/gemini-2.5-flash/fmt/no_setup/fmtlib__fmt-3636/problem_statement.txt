Windows API systems without UTF-16 APIs
Currently the Windows build assumes that `WriteConsoleW` is available.

None of the Unicode stuff is actually available on Windows 98 (and similar API level systems such as the original Xbox).

Would you be OK with adding a build option to disable it? I can send a PR if so.
Is `FMT_WINDOWS_HAS_UNICODE_APIS` a good name for the build option?

Alternatively, perhaps we could add an option to disable the entire `print` subsystem (something like `set(FMT_PRINT OFF)`)
