Feature Request: Print std::chrono::time_point
Hello. I love using your library. 

I saw [this](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/985) issue but it was closed. Here is my usecase of time_point:
```
class record {
std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> last_modified, ...;
void init() {
    last_modified = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
}
void expired() {
    return ((std::chrono::system_clock::now() - last_modified) >  std::chrono::hours(8));
}
// Bunch of other operations that add/subtract duration to another time_point member.
};
```
I want to implement a `print()` that displays the time_point members. Here is what I do now:
```
void print() {
    const auto time_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(last_modified);
    std::cout << std::ctime(&time_c);
}
```
I would like to use `fmt::print("{}", last_modified)` and be done with it. Could you please consider my request?
