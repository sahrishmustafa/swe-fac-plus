Compile-time error when mixing named argument with automatic indexing
Minimal reproducer ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bxYGbn9cE)):
```
fmt::print("{} {a}", 1, "a"_a = 2);
```

I believe this is supposed to compile, but it causes:
```
on_error("cannot switch from automatic to manual argument indexing");
```

Are the named arguments considered as "indexed", or is it a bug?

It works with `fmt::runtime`, so if nothing else, there is a problem with consistency between compile-time and runtime checking.
