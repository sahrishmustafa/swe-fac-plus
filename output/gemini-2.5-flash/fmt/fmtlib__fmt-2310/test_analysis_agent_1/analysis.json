  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `apt install` step (Step 4/7) with a '404 Not Found' error for the 'libssh-4' package. This typically indicates a transient issue with package mirrors or a package version being superseded shortly after `apt update` fetched the package list. To make the Dockerfile build more robust against such temporary network or repository inconsistencies, add a retry mechanism to the `apt install` command. Modify Step 4/7 as follows:\n\n```dockerfile\n# System dependencies installation. Installs essential tools and libraries required for development and runtime\n# build-essential provides gcc, g++, and make, which are necessary for compiling C++ projects.\n# cmake is the required build system.\n# git is for cloning the repository.\n# ca-certificates is added to fix SSL certificate verification issues during git clone.\n# python3 and curl are included as per the reference Dockerfile, suggesting their use in supporting scripts.\nRUN apt update && \\\n    for i in $(seq 1 5); do \\\n        apt install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential cmake git ca-certificates python3 curl && break; \\\n        echo \"Attempt $i failed to install dependencies, retrying in 5 seconds...\"; \\\n        sleep 5; \\\n    done && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n```\nThis change wraps the `apt install` command in a retry loop, attempting to install the packages up to 5 times if it fails, with a 5-second delay between attempts. This should help overcome transient `404` errors by allowing `apt` to potentially fetch a corrected or updated package list/file on subsequent tries.",
