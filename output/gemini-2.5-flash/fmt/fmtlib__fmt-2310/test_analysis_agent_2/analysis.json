  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` command with a 'fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus'. This typically indicates an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error or resource exhaustion during compilation. The `make -j$(nproc)` command tries to utilize all available CPU cores, which can consume significant memory and lead to issues in resource-constrained environments. To resolve this, modify the `make` command to limit the number of parallel jobs.\n\nSpecifically, in the last `RUN` instruction where `make -j$(nproc)` is used:\n\nChange:\n`make -j$(nproc)`\n\nTo something like:\n`make -j2` (or `make -j1` if `make -j2` also fails, to build with minimal concurrency).\n\nLet's start by trying `make -j2` to allow some parallelism while reducing memory pressure. If this still fails, revert to `make -j1` for maximum stability.",
