This typically indicates an out-of-memory (OOM) issue during compilation. The evaluation script uses `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`, which attempts to utilize all available CPU cores, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption on resource-constrained environments. To resolve this, modify both `cmake --build` commands in the eval script. Change `-j$(nproc)` to a lower, fixed number of parallel jobs, such as `-j2` (consistent with the Dockerfile's build setting), to prevent OOM errors and allow the build to complete successfully. The relevant lines to update are:\n- Line 51: `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`\n- Line 106: `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`",
