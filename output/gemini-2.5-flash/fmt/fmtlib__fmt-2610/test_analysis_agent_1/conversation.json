If the tests did not run correctly, determine whether the issue is related to:\n   - The **Dockerfile** (environment setup issues)\n   - The **evaluation script** (test execution issues)\n   - Missing information that needs to be collected\n\n3.

Be sure to check the versions of critical dependencies to ensure compatibility.\n- If there are missing dependencies or unknown errors, consider whether additional context retrieval is required.\n- Tests should not be run in the Dockerfile**; skip tests during environment setup and run them in the evaluation script.\n- Note that the eval script MUST catch exit code after running tests, and echo \"OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc\". This is important for judge whether tests are run successfully.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan Corrective Actions**\n- If a fix is needed in the **Dockerfile**, provide guidance to `write_dockerfile_agent` on how to fix it.\n- If a fix is needed in the **evaluation script**, provide guidance to `write_eval_script_agent` on how to fix it.\n- If more information from the target repository is needed, provide guidance to `context_retrieval_agent` on what to collect.\n\n### **Output Format**\nProvide your answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"is_finish\": true/false,  # If tests passed and everything is correct, set this to true.\n    \"guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent\": \"<Provide detailed guidance if modifications are needed>\",\n    \"guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent\": \"<Provide detailed guidance if modifications are needed>\",\n    \"guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent\": \"<Specify what additional information from the target repository is needed, if any>\",\n}\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- If `is_finish` is `true`, all guidance fields can be empty.\n- Be specific in your guidance, providing detailed steps for the necessary fixes.
