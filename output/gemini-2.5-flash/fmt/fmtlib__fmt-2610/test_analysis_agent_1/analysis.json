While the primary failure was in the eval script, the Dockerfile also uses `make -j$(nproc)` during the initial build. To make the environment setup more robust and prevent potential OOM issues during the Docker build phase, it is recommended to limit the number of parallel compilation jobs. Please change `make -j$(nproc)` to `make -j2` or a similar small, fixed number (e.g., `make -j4`) to reduce memory pressure during the initial project build within the Dockerfile.",
  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The log shows 'c++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus compilation terminated.' (lines 118-119), leading to a build failure (`build_rc=2`, lines 141-149). This 'Killed signal' is a strong indicator of an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error during the parallel compilation step triggered by `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)`. The build failed before the `ctest` command could be executed for `test/core-test.cc`. To resolve this, reduce the number of parallel jobs used during the build phase to prevent resource exhaustion. Modify the `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` command to use a fixed, smaller number of parallel jobs, such as `-j2` (or `-j4` if `--build . -j2` is too slow). This will limit the concurrent memory usage and should allow the compilation to complete successfully.",
