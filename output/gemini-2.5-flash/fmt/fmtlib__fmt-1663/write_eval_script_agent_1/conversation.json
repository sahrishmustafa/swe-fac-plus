Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):\n*   Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian based). A stable Ubuntu LTS version like `ubuntu:20.04` or `ubuntu:22.04` is suitable.\n*   Build Tools:\n    *   `cmake` (version >= 3.1.0).\n    *   `build-essential` (provides `make`, `g++`, etc.).\n    *   Specific C++ compiler versions from Travis CI: `g++-6` or `g++-8`, `clang-4.0` or `clang-6.0`. It's safer to install a more recent `g++` (e.g., `g++-9` or `g++-11`) that supports C++11, C++14, and C++17. `build-essential` typically provides a default good enough version.\n*   Source Control: `git`.\n*   Other Utilities: `curl`.\n*   Scripting: `python` (Python 2.x was used by `travis-build.py`, though we can re-implement the core logic in shell for simplicity or install Python 2 if directly calling the script).\n\n2. Test Execution (for Evaluation Script):\n*   Project Structure: Standard CMake project.\n*   Build Directory: Tests are typically run from a dedicated build directory (e.g., `build` or `_build`).\n*   CMake Configuration:\n    ```bash\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    cmake -DFMT_DOC=OFF -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14\n    ```\n    (These flags are commonly used in CI and ensure a robust build).\n*   Build Command:\n    ```bash\n    cmake --build . -j$(nproc)\n    ```\n    or\n    ```bash\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    ```\n*   Test Execution: The project uses Google Test/Mock integrated with CTest. The standard way to run all registered tests, including `test/core-test.cc`, is:\n    ```bash\n    CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test\n    # Alternatively, directly with ctest from the build directory:\n    # ctest --output-on-failure\n    ```\n    The `test/core-test.cc` is compiled into a `core-test` executable by CMake's `add_fmt_test` function in `test/CMakeLists.txt` and registered with CTest. Therefore, running `make test` will discover and execute it.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
