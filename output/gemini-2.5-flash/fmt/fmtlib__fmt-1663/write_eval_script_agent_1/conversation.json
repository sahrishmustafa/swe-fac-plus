Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4.

We will use a recent LTS version (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04) for the Dockerfile.\n*   Required Dependencies:\n    *   Build Tools: `build-essential` (for `g++`, `make`), `clang` (for alternative compiler testing), `cmake` (minimum 3.1.0).\n    *   Version Control: `git` (good practice, though not strictly needed since the repo is cloned).\n    *   Scripting Language: `python3` (as `travis-build.py` was used, though not directly applicable for direct CMake workflow).\n*   C++ Standard: The project requires C++11 at minimum and is tested with C++14/17. Modern compilers (GCC/Clang provided by `build-essential` and `clang`) will satisfy this.\n*   Build Process:\n    1.  Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build`).\n    2.  Navigate into the build directory (`cd build`).\n    3.  Configure CMake: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (Release is common and efficient).\n    4.  Build the project: `make -j$(nproc)`.\n*   Testing Framework: CTest.\n*   Test Execution:\n    1.  After building, navigate to the build directory.\n    2.  Run the specific test (`test/core-test.cc`) using CTest with a regular expression filter: `ctest -R \"core-test\" --output-on-failure`.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''.
