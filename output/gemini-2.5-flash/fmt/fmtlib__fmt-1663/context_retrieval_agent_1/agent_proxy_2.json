This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

If yes, please give a summary of the collected information.(leave it empty if you don't collect enough information)\nYes, I have collected sufficient information to create both the Dockerfile and the evaluation script.\n\n**Summary of Collected Information:**\n\n**1. Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):**\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian based). A stable Ubuntu LTS version like `ubuntu:20.04` or `ubuntu:22.04` is suitable.\n*   **Build Tools:**\n    *   `cmake` (version >= 3.1.0).\n    *   `build-essential` (provides `make`, `g++`, etc.).\n    *   Specific C++ compiler versions from Travis CI: `g++-6` or `g++-8`, `clang-4.0` or `clang-6.0`. It's safer to install a more recent `g++` (e.g., `g++-9` or `g++-11`) that supports C++11, C++14, and C++17. `build-essential` typically provides a default good enough version.\n*   **Source Control:** `git`.\n*   **Other Utilities:** `curl`.\n*   **Scripting:** `python` (Python 2.x was used by `travis-build.py`, though we can re-implement the core logic in shell for simplicity or install Python 2 if directly calling the script).\n\n**2. Test Execution (for Evaluation Script):**\n*   **Project Structure:** Standard CMake project.\n*   **Build Directory:** Tests are typically run from a dedicated build directory (e.g., `build` or `_build`).\n*   **CMake Configuration:**\n    ```bash\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    cmake -DFMT_DOC=OFF -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14\n    ```\n    (These flags are commonly used in CI and ensure a robust build).\n*   **Build Command:**\n    ```bash\n    cmake --build . -j$(nproc)\n    ```\n    or\n    ```bash\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    ```\n*   **Test Execution:** The project uses Google Test/Mock integrated with CTest. The standard way to run all registered tests, including `test/core-test.cc`, is:\n    ```bash\n    CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test\n    # Alternatively, directly with ctest from the build directory:\n    # ctest --output-on-failure\n    ```\n    The `test/core-test.cc` is compiled into a `core-test` executable by CMake's `add_fmt_test` function in `test/CMakeLists.txt` and registered with CTest. Therefore, running `make test` will discover and execute it.\n\n- If we do not collect enough information, what repo browsing API calls we use to get more information.
