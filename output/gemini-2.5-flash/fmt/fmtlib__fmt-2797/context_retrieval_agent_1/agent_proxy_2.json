This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

Given common C++ development, a Debian/Ubuntu-based image is a good default.\n*   **Core Tools/Dependencies**:\n    *   **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compliant compiler is required (e.g., GCC or Clang).

Can be installed via package manager.\n*   **Project-Specific Dependencies**:\n    *   The `fmt` library itself is self-contained.\n    *   Google Test (gtest) is included as a sub-directory in the repository (`test/gtest`), so no external installation of gtest is needed.\n    *   No other external C++ libraries (like Boost) are explicitly required.\n*   **Build Commands**:\n    1.  `mkdir build`\n    2.  `cd build`\n    3.  `cmake ..` (This configures the build system. `FMT_TEST` is ON by default, enabling test targets.)\n    4.  `cmake --build .` (This compiles the library and the test executables.)\n*   **Test Execution Commands**:\n    *   From the `build` directory:\n        *   `ctest` (This will discover and run all tests defined in `test/CMakeLists.txt` via `add_test` calls).\n        *   Alternatively: `cmake --build . --target test` (This also runs all tests).\n*   **Target Test Files**: `test/CMakeLists.txt` defines how the tests are built and run. The goal is to ensure `ctest` can successfully execute the tests defined within it.\n\nBased on this, a `Dockerfile` will involve installing CMake, `build-essential`, cloning the repo, and performing the build/configure steps. The `eval.sh` script will navigate to the build directory and run `ctest`.\n\nI do not need more context.</analysis>"
