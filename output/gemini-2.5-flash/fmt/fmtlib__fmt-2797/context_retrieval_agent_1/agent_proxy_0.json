This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

Given that the target test file is `test/CMakeLists.txt` and there's a root `CMakeLists.txt`, it's highly likely that CMake is used for building and testing.\n\nHere's my plan to gather the necessary information:\n\n1.  **Examine `CMakeLists.txt` (root)**: This file will provide details about the project's C++ standard, required compilers, and any external dependencies. It will also show the general build process.\n2.  **Examine `test/CMakeLists.txt`**: This file is crucial for understanding how the tests themselves are defined and executed within the CMake build system. It will tell us how test executables are created and potentially how `ctest` is configured.\n3.  **Examine `README.rst` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: These files often contain high-level instructions for building and testing the project.\n4.  **Check `.github/workflows`**: CI/CD configurations usually provide the exact commands used to set up the environment and run tests, which can be very helpful.\n\nI will use the following API calls:\n\n- `browse_file_for_environment_info(\"CMakeLists.txt\", \"Identify C++ standard, required dependencies (boost, etc.), and general build instructions.
