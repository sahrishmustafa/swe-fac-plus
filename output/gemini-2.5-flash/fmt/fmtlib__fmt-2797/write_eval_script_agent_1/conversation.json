        "content": "Generate an **evaluation script** based on the collected environment setup and test execution information.  \nThe script must execute the provided test files inside the specified Docker environment.\n\n### **Requirements:**\n1. **Activate the environment**: Ensure the correct environment (e.g., Conda, venv) is activated before running the tests.\n2. **Apply the test patch (if required)**: The test patch may need to be applied before running the tests.\n3. **Rebuild the test binary or recompile the project after applying the test patch**: This ensures that any new or updated tests from the patch are present in the compiled test executable.\n4. **Execute the given test files** using the correct command found by the context retrieval agent.\n5. **Ensure proper cleanup**: After running the tests, any modified files should be reset.\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''.
