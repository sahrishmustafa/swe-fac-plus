Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. Use the correct test execution commands as collected by the **context retrieval agent**.\n\nThe generated script must follow best practices, ensuring all necessary steps are performed to successfully run the tests."

        "content": "Collected information from context retrieval agent:\n**1. Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System**: A Linux distribution like Ubuntu is suitable, as indicated by the use of `apt-get` packages in the Travis CI configuration.\n*   **Required Tools/Packages**:\n    *   **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compliant compiler is needed. `g++-8` (or newer) is a robust choice as it supports C++17, which is used in the project's CI builds.\n    *   **CMake**: Versions 3.1 to 3.18 are supported. A recent version installed via package manager (`apt-get install cmake`) will work.\n    *   **Make**: Standard build utility, usually part of `build-essential` on Linux.\n    *   **Git**: For cloning the repository.\n*   **Dependencies**: The core `fmt` library is self-contained and has no external dependencies. The testing frameworks (Google Test, Google Mock) are bundled within the repository's `test/gtest` and `test/gmock` subdirectories and are built as part of the project. No separate installation steps are required for them.\n\n**2. Building the Project:**\n\n*   The project uses **CMake** as its build system.\n*   Standard build process:\n    1.  Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build`).\n    2.  Navigate into the build directory (`cd build`).\n    3.  Configure CMake, ensuring tests are enabled:\n        `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`\n        (Using `Release` for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `17` for `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` aligns with common CI practices, though `14` or `11` would also work if explicitly needed for the test patch).\n    4.  Build the project:\n        `make -j$(nproc)` (or `cmake --build .`)\n\n**3. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Test Framework**: Google Test/Google Mock.\n*   **Test Executable Naming**: For a test file like `test/chrono-test.cc`, the CMake build system will create an executable named `chrono-test` (as indicated by `add_fmt_test` calling `add_fmt_executable` in `test/CMakeLists.txt`). This executable will be located within the build directory structure (e.g., typically `build/test/chrono-test`).\n*   **Running the Target Test File (`test/chrono-test.cc`):**\n    *   From the `build` directory:\n        `ctest -R chrono-test` (This will find and run the `chrono-test` executable via CTest).\n    *   Alternatively, run the executable directly (from the repository root, assuming `build` is the build directory):\n        `./build/X/chrono-test` (where `X` might be `test/` or a build type directory like `Debug/` depending on the system and CMake generator, but usually `build/test/chrono-test` on Linux).\n        This direct execution of `chrono-test` will run all Google Tests defined within `test/chrono-test.cc`.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
