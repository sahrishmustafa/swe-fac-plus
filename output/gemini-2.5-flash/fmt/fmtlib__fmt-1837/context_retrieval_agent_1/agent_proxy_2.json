This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System**: A Linux distribution like Ubuntu is suitable, as indicated by the use of `apt-get` packages in the Travis CI configuration.\n*   **Required Tools/Packages**:\n    *   **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compliant compiler is needed. `g++-8` (or newer) is a robust choice as it supports C++17, which is used in the project's CI builds.\n    *   **CMake**: Versions 3.1 to 3.18 are supported. A recent version installed via package manager (`apt-get install cmake`) will work.\n    *   **Make**: Standard build utility, usually part of `build-essential` on Linux.\n    *   **Git**: For cloning the repository.\n*   **Dependencies**: The core `fmt` library is self-contained and has no external dependencies. The testing frameworks (Google Test, Google Mock) are bundled within the repository's `test/gtest` and `test/gmock` subdirectories and are built as part of the project. No separate installation steps are required for them.\n\n**2. Building the Project:**\n\n*   The project uses **CMake** as its build system.\n*   Standard build process:\n    1.  Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build`).\n    2.  Navigate into the build directory (`cd build`).\n    3.  Configure CMake, ensuring tests are enabled:\n        `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`\n        (Using `Release` for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `17` for `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` aligns with common CI practices, though `14` or `11` would also work if explicitly needed for the test patch).\n    4.  Build the project:\n        `make -j$(nproc)` (or `cmake --build .`)\n\n**3. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Test Framework**: Google Test/Google Mock.\n*   **Test Executable Naming**: For a test file like `test/chrono-test.cc`, the CMake build system will create an executable named `chrono-test` (as indicated by `add_fmt_test` calling `add_fmt_executable` in `test/CMakeLists.txt`). This executable will be located within the build directory structure (e.g., typically `build/test/chrono-test`).\n*   **Running the Target Test File (`test/chrono-test.cc`):**\n    *   From the `build` directory:\n        `ctest -R chrono-test` (This will find and run the `chrono-test` executable via CTest).\n    *   Alternatively, run the executable directly (from the repository root, assuming `build` is the build directory):\n        `./build/X/chrono-test` (where `X` might be `test/` or a build type directory like `Debug/` depending on the system and CMake generator, but usually `build/test/chrono-test` on Linux).\n        This direct execution of `chrono-test` will run all Google Tests defined within `test/chrono-test.cc`.\n\nThis information is sufficient to build the environment, compile the project including its tests, and specifically execute the tests associated with `test/chrono-test.cc`.</analysis>"
