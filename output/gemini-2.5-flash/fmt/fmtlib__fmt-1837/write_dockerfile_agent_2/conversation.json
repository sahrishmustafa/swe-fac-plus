Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System**: A Linux distribution like Ubuntu is suitable, as indicated by the use of `apt-get` packages in the Travis CI configuration.\n*   **Required Tools/Packages**:\n    *   **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compliant compiler is needed. `g++-8` (or newer) is a robust choice as it supports C++17, which is used in the project's CI builds.\n    *   **CMake**: Versions 3.1 to 3.18 are supported. A recent version installed via package manager (`apt-get install cmake`) will work.\n    *   **Make**: Standard build utility, usually part of `build-essential` on Linux.\n    *   **Git**: For cloning the repository.\n*   **Dependencies**: The core `fmt` library is self-contained and has no external dependencies. The testing frameworks (Google Test, Google Mock) are bundled within the repository's `test/gtest` and `test/gmock` subdirectories and are built as part of the project. No separate installation steps are required for them.\n\n**2. Building the Project:**\n\n*   The project uses **CMake** as its build system.\n*   Standard build process:\n    1.  Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build`).\n    2.  Navigate into the build directory (`cd build`).\n    3.  Configure CMake, ensuring tests are enabled:\n        `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`\n        (Using `Release` for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `17` for `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` aligns with common CI practices, though `14` or `11` would also work if explicitly needed for the test patch).\n    4.  Build the project:\n        `make -j$(nproc)` (or `cmake --build .`)\n\n**3. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Test Framework**: Google Test/Google Mock.\n*   **Test Executable Naming**: For a test file like `test/chrono-test.cc`, the CMake build system will create an executable named `chrono-test` (as indicated by `add_fmt_test` calling `add_fmt_executable` in `test/CMakeLists.txt`). This executable will be located within the build directory structure (e.g., typically `build/test/chrono-test`).\n*   **Running the Target Test File (`test/chrono-test.cc`):**\n    *   From the `build` directory:\n        `ctest -R chrono-test` (This will find and run the `chrono-test` executable via CTest).\n    *   Alternatively, run the executable directly (from the repository root, assuming `build` is the build directory):\n        `./build/X/chrono-test` (where `X` might be `test/` or a build type directory like `Debug/` depending on the system and CMake generator, but usually `build/test/chrono-test` on Linux).\n        This direct execution of `chrono-test` will run all Google Tests defined within `test/chrono-test.cc`.\n\n"

You are FORBIDDEN to run tests in the dockerfile, tests will be run using eval script.\n2. When building the Dockerfile, you MUST prioritize using package managers such as Conda, Maven, or NPM etc to set up the environment efficiently.\n3. Ensure shell compatibility by using `/bin/bash` as the default shell environment to avoid runtime issues.  For example, **do not use `FROM alpine:latest`**, as it lacks `/bin/bash` by default, which may cause runtime errors. Instead, use a base image like `ubuntu:22.04` or `debian:bookworm` that includes Bash by default.\n4. Pay more attention when using Ubuntu-based images**, as different versions may have variations in default packages, dependency resolution, and package manager behavior, which could lead to unexpected errors.\n5. DO NOT use `COPY` to copy local files** into the Docker container.  \n   - For example, avoid using `COPY package.json /testbed/` or `COPY requirements.txt /testbed/`.  \n   - Instead, all files should be retrieved directly by **cloning the repository** inside the container to ensure a fully reproducible environment.\n6. DO NOT run tests in the Dockerfile**.  \n   - Do not include commands like `npm test`, `pytest`, or `mvn test` in the Dockerfile.  \n   - Tests will be executed separately, and running them during the Docker build stage is an unnecessary overhead.\n   - You can skip tests during environment setup because this is not your job.\n\n7. If there is a reference Dockerfile, use it as a guideline.   \n8. Do not use ENTRYPOINT.\n9. Please install necessary essential tools and libraries required for development and runtime, such as git etc.\n10. When setting up dependencies for the target repository (e.g., `torch 3.33`), **DO NOT** install the package directly from external registries (e.g., PyPI, NPM, Maven Central) using commands like `pip install <package>` (e.g., `pip install torch`).  \n   Instead, **you can install the repository itself in development mode** (`pip install -e .` for Python, `npm link` for Node.js, or `mvn install` for Java) to ensure that the local repository\u2019s code is correctly referenced during execution.\n   **Why is this important?**  \n   - If you modify the repository\u2019s source code but have already installed a pre-built package from the registry, your system may load the installed package instead of your local code, **leading to incorrect test results and making debugging difficult**.  \n   - Using development mode installation (`pip install -e .`, `npm link`, `mvn install`) ensures that the system always references the latest local repository code, preventing version mismatches and ensuring that modifications are properly reflected in subsequent tests.\n\n\n\n### **Example Format:**\nThe Dockerfile must be wrapped in `<dockerfile>` tags.
