_wfopen support
On Windows it is important to use UTF-16 file paths for opening files (at least until recent versions that allow using UTF-8 locale for WinAPI).

std::fstream has overload for std::wstring
for std::FILE* there is Windows-specific "_wfopen" method as a replacement for standard std::fopen.

Is it possible to provide a way to use fmt::output_file with UTF-16 encoded filepath?
