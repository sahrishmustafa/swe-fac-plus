Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System:** Ubuntu (20.04 is a good modern choice, as CI uses 18.04 and 20.04).\n*   **Required Packages:**\n    *   `build-essential` (provides `g++`, `make`, etc.)\n    *   `cmake`\n    *   Specific C++ compilers (e.g., `g++-10` and `clang-11` if both are desired, but `g++-10` is sufficient).\n    *   `libc++-11-dev` and `libc++abi-11-dev` (for `clang` if used with `libc++` standard library).\n    *   `locales-all` (for general locale setup).\n*   **C++ Standard:** C++11 is required, but newer compilers like `g++-10` or `clang-11` support C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, automatically handling the requirement.\n\n**2. Building and Testing (for Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Build System:** CMake.\n*   **Test Target:** Tests are enabled by `FMT_TEST=ON` CMake option (which is default `ON` if fmt is the master project, but explicitly setting is safer).\n*   **Build Steps:**\n    1.  Create a build directory (e.g., `build`).\n    2.  Navigate into the build directory.\n    3.  Configure with CMake: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_TEST=ON`. It's good practice to specify `Release` for consistent builds.\n    4.  Build the project: `cmake --build .` or `make -j$(nproc)`.\n*   **Test Execution:**\n    1.  Change directory to the build directory (if not already there).\n    2.  Set `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=True` environment variable for detailed test output.\n    3.  Execute tests using CTest: `ctest -C Release`. This command will automatically discover and run all tests configured for the Release build type, including `test/color-test.cc`.\n*   **Compiler Choice for Script:** Using `g++-10` is a solid choice. The `CXX` environment variable can be set to `g++-10` before CMake configuration if necessary, though `update-alternatives` might also be used. For simplicity, just installing `g++-10` and `cmake` should generally work."
