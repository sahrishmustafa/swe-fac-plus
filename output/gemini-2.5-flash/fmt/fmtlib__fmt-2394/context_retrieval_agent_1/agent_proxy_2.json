This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"
