truncating_iterator is no std::output_iterator
My formatter for a custom type has C++20 delegates to a function that has a requirement `template <std::output_iterator<char> It>`. Unfortunately, that one fails when used within `fmt::format_to_n`, because the iterator found in `ctx.out()` is of type `fmt::v6::internal::truncating_iterator<char*, std::false_type>`. That one fails to be a `std::output_iterator`, apparently because it is missing default construction. Potentially, there are other requirements missing.

Is there fundamentally preventing that object from being an output iterator, or has the requirement simply not come up before?
