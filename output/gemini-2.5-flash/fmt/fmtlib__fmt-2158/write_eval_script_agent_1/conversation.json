Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4.

Dockerfile Information (Environment Setup):\n\nBase OS: A standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.\nRequired Tools/Compilers:\nC++ Compiler: GCC (g++) is recommended, version 6.0 or newer. Clang is also compatible. The `build-essential` meta-package usually provides GCC and `make`.\nBuild System: CMake, version 3.1 or newer.\nBuild Tool: `make`.\nDependencies: The core library has no external dependencies. Google Test and Google Mock are included as submodules/internal components, so no external package installations are needed for them.\nC++ Standard: C++11 is the minimum requirement.\nCommon CMake Flags for Build:\n`-DFMT_TEST=ON`: Crucial for enabling the building of test executables.\n`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Standard build type, good for performance and typically sufficient for tests.\n`-S . -B build`: Standard out-of-source build configuration for CMake.\n\n2. Evaluation Script Information (Build and Test Execution):\n\nBuild Steps:\nCreate a build directory: `mkdir build`\nConfigure CMake: `cmake -S . -B build -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (executed from the repository root)\nBuild the project: `cmake --build build` (executed from the repository root)\nTest Framework: Google Test/Google Mock.\nTest Runner: `ctest`.\nTarget Test File: `test/format-test.cc`\nSpecific Test Name for `ctest`: `format-test`. This name is derived from `add_fmt_test(format-test ...)` in `test/CMakeLists.txt`.\nCommand to run the specific test:\nChange directory to the build folder: `cd build`\nExecute the test: `ctest -R format-test` (executed from within the `build` directory).\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''.
