Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System:** A recent Ubuntu distribution, such as **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**, is suitable. This provides a stable base with access to necessary tools and compilers.\n*   **Required Dependencies (apt packages):**\n    *   `cmake`: The build system generator (minimum version 3.1.0 is required).\n    *   `g++`: A C++ compiler (the default `g++` on Ubuntu 20.04 supports C++14).\n    *   `ninja-build`: A faster build system alternative to `make` (optional but recommended, as seen in Travis config).\n    *   `git`: For repository operations (typically pre-installed or easily added).\n    *   `python3`: To execute helper scripts like `support/travis-build.py`, although we will derive the direct commands from it.\n    *   `curl`: A general utility.\n*   **C++ Standard:** The project requires **C++14**.\n\n**2. Build and Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Build System:** The project uses CMake for its build process.\n*   **Build Steps:**\n    1.  **Navigate to the root of the repository.**\n    2.  **Create a build directory:** `mkdir build && cd build`.\n    3.  **Configure CMake:** This step generates the build files in the `build` directory.\n        `cmake -S .. -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14`\n        *   `-S ..`: Specifies the source directory (the repository root).\n        *   `-DFMT_TEST=ON`: This flag is critical as it enables the compilation of the test executables, including those relevant to `test/format-impl-test.cc` and `test/grisu-test.cc`.\n        *   `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Sets the build type, typically used in CI environments for optimized builds.\n        *   `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14`: Explicitly sets the C++ standard to C++14.\n    4.  **Build the project:** This compiles the source code and the test targets.\n        `cmake --build .` (or `make -j$(nproc)` if using Makefiles and parallel compilation).\n*   **Test Execution:**\n    1.  **Ensure correct environment variable:** `export CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1`. This helps in debugging by showing full test output on failures.\n    2.  **Run tests:** After building, the tests can be executed using CMake's test driver.\n        `cmake --build . --target test` (This command is equivalent to `make test` in a Makefile-based build and triggers CTest).\n        *   This command will discover and run all tests enabled by `DFMT_TEST=ON`, including `test/format-impl-test.cc` and `test/grisu-test.cc`.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7.
