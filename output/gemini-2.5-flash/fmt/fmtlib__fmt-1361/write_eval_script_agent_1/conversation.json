Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. Use the correct test execution commands as collected by the **context retrieval agent**.\n\nThe generated script must follow best practices, ensuring all necessary steps are performed to successfully run the tests."

Environment Setup (Dockerfile):\n*   Base OS: A Debian/Ubuntu-based image is suitable as `apt` is used for package management.\n*   Required Packages (Linux via apt): `g++-8`, `g++-6`, `clang-6.0`, `clang-4.0`, `cmake`, `make`, `python` (specifically for Python 2 as `travis-build.py` uses features like `print_function` from `__future__` and `urllib.urlretrieve`), `curl`.\n*   Build System: CMake (minimum version 3.1.0) and Make.\n*   Language: C++.\n*   Target C++ Standard: Both C++14 and C++17 are supported and used in Travis CI. We can choose C++17 with `g++-8` or `clang-6.0` for the evaluation.\n\n2. Build Process:\n*   Steps: The project is built using CMake. A typical workflow involves:\n    1.  Creating a build directory (e.g., `_build`).\n    2.  Navigating into the build directory.\n    3.  Configuring with CMake: `cmake -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 ..` (adjusting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and compiler flags as needed).\n    4.  Building: `cmake --build .` or `make -j$(nproc)` in the build directory.\n*   Key CMake Options:\n    *   `FMT_PEDANTIC=ON`: Enables strict warnings.\n    *   `FMT_WERROR=ON`: Treats warnings as errors.\n    *   `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1`: Ensures test output is shown on failure.\n    *   `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Standard build type.\n    *   `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`: Specifies the C++ standard.\n\n3. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):\n*   Test Framework: CTest, integrated with CMake.\n*   Execution Command: After building, tests are run by executing `make test` from the build directory.\n*   Environment Variables: `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` should be set before running `make test` to ensure detailed output on test failures.\n*   The target test files (`test/format-impl-test.cc`, `test/grisu-test.cc`) are part of the broader test suite invoked by `make test`. Specific invocation of individual `*.cc` files is usually not required; building the `ALL_BUILD` target and then running `make test` (which triggers CTest) should execute all defined tests.\n\n"

        "content": "Generate an **evaluation script** based on the collected environment setup and test execution information.  \nThe script must execute the provided test files inside the specified Docker environment.\n\n### **Requirements:**\n1. **Activate the environment**: Ensure the correct environment (e.g., Conda, venv) is activated before running the tests.\n2. **Apply the test patch (if required)**: The test patch may need to be applied before running the tests.\n3. **Execute the given test files** using the correct command found by the context retrieval agent.\n4. **Ensure proper cleanup**: After running the tests, any modified files should be reset.\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
