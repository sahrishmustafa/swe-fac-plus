This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n*   **Base OS**: A Debian/Ubuntu-based image is suitable as `apt` is used for package management.\n*   **Required Packages (Linux via apt)**: `g++-8`, `g++-6`, `clang-6.0`, `clang-4.0`, `cmake`, `make`, `python` (specifically for Python 2 as `travis-build.py` uses features like `print_function` from `__future__` and `urllib.urlretrieve`), `curl`.\n*   **Build System**: CMake (minimum version 3.1.0) and Make.\n*   **Language**: C++.\n*   **Target C++ Standard**: Both C++14 and C++17 are supported and used in Travis CI. We can choose C++17 with `g++-8` or `clang-6.0` for the evaluation.\n\n**2. Build Process:**\n*   **Steps**: The project is built using CMake. A typical workflow involves:\n    1.  Creating a build directory (e.g., `_build`).\n    2.  Navigating into the build directory.\n    3.  Configuring with CMake: `cmake -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 ..` (adjusting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and compiler flags as needed).\n    4.  Building: `cmake --build .` or `make -j$(nproc)` in the build directory.\n*   **Key CMake Options**:\n    *   `FMT_PEDANTIC=ON`: Enables strict warnings.\n    *   `FMT_WERROR=ON`: Treats warnings as errors.\n    *   `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1`: Ensures test output is shown on failure.\n    *   `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Standard build type.\n    *   `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`: Specifies the C++ standard.\n\n**3. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n*   **Test Framework**: CTest, integrated with CMake.\n*   **Execution Command**: After building, tests are run by executing `make test` from the build directory.\n*   **Environment Variables**: `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` should be set before running `make test` to ensure detailed output on test failures.\n*   The target test files (`test/format-impl-test.cc`, `test/grisu-test.cc`) are part of the broader test suite invoked by `make test`. Specific invocation of individual `*.cc` files is usually not required; building the `ALL_BUILD` target and then running `make test` (which triggers CTest) should execute all defined tests.</analysis>"
