Ensure the evaluation script properly activates the environment inside the Docker container.\n2. Apply the test patch (if needed) before executing the tests.\n3. **After applying the test patch, always rebuild the test binary or recompile the project as required, so that any new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n4. Use the correct test execution commands as collected by the **context retrieval agent**.\n\nThe generated script must follow best practices, ensuring all necessary steps are performed to successfully run the tests."

Create a build directory (e.g., `_build`).\n    2.  Run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DFMT_TEST=ON -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_WERROR=ON`.\n    3.  Run `cmake --build .` (or `make -j$(nproc)` for parallel build).\n*   Test Execution:\n    1.  Run `make test` within the build directory.\n    2.  Set `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` environment variable for detailed test output.\n    3.  Important Note: The provided test files (`test/core-test.cc`, `test/locale-test.cc`) cannot be individually targeted via the `make test` command. `make test` will execute the *entire* CTest suite defined by the project.

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6. **After applying the test patch, you must rebuild the test binary or recompile the project so that the new or modified tests are included in the executable.**\n    - For example, if using CMake, you might run `cmake --build .` or `make` after patching.\n    - If using another build system, use the appropriate command to ensure the test binary is up to date.\n    - **CRITICAL: If the build/compilation step fails, the script must immediately set rc=1 and exit. Do not continue to run tests if the build fails, as this may run outdated binaries and produce false positive results.**\n\n7. You MUST capture the exit code immediately after running the tests using ``rc=$? '', and then echo: ``OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc''. This ensures the judge can determine whether the tests passed successfully.\n\nEval script skeleton:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -uxo pipefail\ncd /testbed\ngit checkout 96f91428c6ad2d19f1ce87ae160b78f52ed989fb \"test/core-test.cc\" \"test/locale-test.cc\"\ngit apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\ngit checkout 96f91428c6ad2d19f1ce87ae160b78f52ed989fb \"test/core-test.cc\" \"test/locale-test.cc\"\n\n\n### **Example Format:**\nThe script must be wrapped in `<script>` tags.
