  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step due to a C++ compilation error. The error is an 'expected unqualified-id before numeric constant' at `/testbed/test/../format.h:1744:20` for `const unsigned CHAR_WIDTH = 1;`. This is a classic macro redefinition conflict, where `CHAR_WIDTH` is defined as a macro in a system header (likely `limits.h`), and `fmtlib` attempts to define its own constant or variable with the same name.\n\nThe `cmake` warning `Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: FMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO` indicates that the specific flag `-DFMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO=0` provided in the Dockerfile's `cmake` command was ignored by the project's build system. Looking at the `fmtlib` source for this commit, `FMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO` is an internal variable that CMake attempts to detect. This detection logic is likely failing on this environment, leading to `fmtlib` incorrectly attempting to define `CHAR_WIDTH` as a constant when it's already a macro.\n\nTo resolve this, explicitly instruct the C++ compiler to undefine the `CHAR_WIDTH` macro when compiling `fmtlib`'s sources. This can be done by adding `-UCHAR_WIDTH` to the CMake CXX flags.\n\n**Action:**\nModify the `RUN` command in the Dockerfile that initiates `cmake` and `make`. Remove the ineffective `-DFMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO=0` flag and add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-UCHAR_WIDTH\"` to the `cmake` command. This will ensure that `CHAR_WIDTH` is undefined before compilation, preventing the conflict.\n\n**Original line:**\n`RUN mkdir build     && cd build     && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_TEST=ON -DFMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO=0 ..     && make -j \"$(nproc)\"`\n\n**Revised line:**\n`RUN mkdir build     && cd build     && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_TEST=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-UCHAR_WIDTH\" ..     && make -j \"$(nproc)\"`\n\nThis change should allow the Dockerfile build to complete successfully.",
