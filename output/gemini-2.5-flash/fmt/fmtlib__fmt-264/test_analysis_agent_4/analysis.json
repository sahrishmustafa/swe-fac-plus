  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step with a compilation error: `error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant const unsigned CHAR_WIDTH = 1;`. This indicates a macro named `CHAR_WIDTH` is being defined by a system header (likely `limits.h` or one included indirectly) which conflicts with a variable named `CHAR_WIDTH` in fmtlib's `format.h`. This is a common issue with `fmtlib` in certain environments or older versions.\n\nTo resolve this, add `-DFMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO=0` to the CMake configuration command within the Dockerfile. This specific CMake definition is designed to mitigate conflicts arising from `CHAR_WIDTH` being defined as a macro. \n\n**Action:** Modify the `RUN` command for `cmake` in the Dockerfile as follows:\nChange:\n`RUN mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_TEST=ON .. && make -j \"$(nproc)\"`\nTo:\n`RUN mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_TEST=ON -DFMT_CHAR_WIDTH_MACRO=0 .. && make -j \"$(nproc)\"`",
