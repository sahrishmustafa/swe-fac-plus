This typically indicates a naming conflict where `CHAR_WIDTH` is defined as a macro in a system header (like `limits.h`) and clashes with a variable name in the older `fmtlib/fmt` source code (commit 97e9ed11b from 2017). This incompatibility arises from using a relatively old codebase with a modern compiler (GCC 11 on Ubuntu 22.04). To resolve this, downgrade the base image to `ubuntu:20.04`, which uses an older GCC (9.3.0). This should provide a more compatible build environment for the given fmtlib version.",
