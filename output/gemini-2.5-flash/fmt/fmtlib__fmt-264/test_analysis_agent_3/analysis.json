  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step with a compilation error: \"error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant const unsigned CHAR_WIDTH = 1;\". This error originates from `/testbed/test/../format.h` and is likely caused by a macro conflict with a system header like `limits.h`, which is implicitly included via `climits`. This kind of conflict often arises when an older codebase (like this fmtlib version from 2014) is compiled with a relatively newer compiler (GCC 7) on a modern system (Ubuntu 20.04) whose system headers might have stricter definitions or different macro behavior.\n\nTo resolve this, we should align the Docker environment more closely with the expected environment for `fmtlib` version 2.0. Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) ships with GCC 7 as its default compiler and an older set of system headers, which is more likely to be compatible.\n\n**Actionable steps for write_dockerfile_agent:**\n1.  **Change the base image**: Replace `FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 ubuntu:20.04` with `FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 ubuntu:18.04`.\n2.  **Adjust compiler installation**: Since `ubuntu:18.04`'s default `gcc` and `g++` are version 7, you can simplify the `apt install` command and remove the explicit `gcc-7` and `g++-7` installations and subsequent `ENV` variable settings. The `build-essential` package will install the default GCC/G++ version for Ubuntu 18.04 (which is GCC 7).\n    *   Modify the `RUN apt update` command to remove `gcc-7` and `g++-7` from the install list.\n    *   Remove the lines `ENV CC=/usr/bin/gcc-7` and `ENV CXX=/usr/bin/g++-7`.",
