  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step with a compilation error: \"error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant\" at `/testbed/test/../format.h:1744:20` for `CHAR_WIDTH`. This usually indicates a conflict, most likely a macro defined in a system header that clashes with a variable name in the `fmtlib` source code. Given the commit SHA (97e9ed11bce828235a25e2cb72910fa6928ffdf5) is from January 2017, and `ubuntu:20.04` ships with GCC 9.4.0, it is highly probable that this older version of `fmtlib` has compatibility issues with newer compilers.\n\nTo resolve this, update the Dockerfile to use an older GCC compiler version that would have been current around the time of the commit (e.g., GCC 7 or 8). Ubuntu 20.04 can still install older GCC versions.\n\n**Specific steps:**\n1. Modify the `apt install` command to include `gcc-7` and `g++-7`.\n2. After installation, explicitly set `gcc-7` and `g++-7` as the default compilers using `update-alternatives` or by setting `CC` and `CXX` environment variables before the `cmake` command.\n\n**Example modification for the Dockerfile's `RUN` command for build-essential:**\n```dockerfile\n# Install essential system dependencies: build-essential for C++ compiler and make, cmake for build system,\n# git for cloning, and gdb for debugging.\nRUN apt update && apt install -y \\\n    build-essential \\\n    cmake \\\n    git \\\n    gdb \\\n    gcc-7 \\\n    g++-7 \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Set GCC 7 as the default compiler. This should be placed before the WORKDIR or build steps.\nENV CC=/usr/bin/gcc-7\nENV CXX=/usr/bin/g++-7\nRUN update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 100 \\\n    --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7\n\n# ... rest of the Dockerfile ...\n\n# The final build command will now use GCC 7:\nRUN mkdir build \\\n    && cd build \\\n    && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMT_PEDANTIC=ON -DFMT_TEST=ON .. \\\n    && make -j \"$(nproc)\"\n```\n\nThis change should address the compilation error by providing a more compatible compiler version for the older fmtlib source.",
