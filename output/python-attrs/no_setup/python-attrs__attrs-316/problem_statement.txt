Generated methods like __init__ lack the __module__ attribute
This issue was initially reported in https://github.com/Stewori/pytypes/issues/18.
Applying ``__module__`` on e.g. the ``__init__`` function generated by attrs raises a ``KeyError``. For more information please refer to the link above.

Being able to retrieve the module for a given function/method is relevant to locate the function or method in the class hierarchy from perspective of a decorator or profiler. Searching a module top-down for a function/method is often the only way to access its enclosing class, including nesting structure of classes.

A workaround that sometimes worked but not in this case is to get the module via ``__code__.co_filename``. However, any valid approach for identifying the corresponding module and/or location in class hierarchy for a generated function would be fine.

Please apologize if I should overlook some approach that is already viable.
