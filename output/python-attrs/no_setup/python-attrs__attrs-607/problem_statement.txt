Auto-detect user-written methods
Currently, if you want to implement a method yourself, you have to remember to do two things:

```python
@attr.s(repr=False)
class C:
    def __repr__(self):
        return "whatever"
```

I’ve seen quite a few people be confused/frustrated by that.

I think unless `these` is set, it would be kind of cool if we detected that the current class (and not some super class) has a user-written method and set the flag to false automatically such that

```python
@attr.s
class C:
    def __repr__(self):
        return "whatever"
```

does what you’d expect.

Opinions?
