assoc warning is unhelpful
Currently the warning emitted looks something like this:
```
/home/mithrandi/deployment/virtualenvs/txaws/site-packages/attr/_funcs.py:173: DeprecationWarning: assoc is deprecated and will be removed after 2018/01.
```
I think this should pass an appropriate stacklevel so you can see where the calling code actually is.
