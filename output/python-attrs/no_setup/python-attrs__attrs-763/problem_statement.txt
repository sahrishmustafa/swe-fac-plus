Python 3.10 compatibility
Hello.

We have already started testing RPM packages in Fedora with Python 3.10a2 and attrs is currently not compatible.

The problem is caused by the implementation of [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#abstract) â€” type annotations are now stored as strings which cause asserts like this one to fail:

```python
class TestAnnotations:
    """
    Tests for types derived from variable annotations (PEP-526).
    """

    def test_basic_annotations(self):
        """
        Sets the `Attribute.type` attr from basic type annotations.
        """

        @attr.s
        class C:
            x: int = attr.ib()
            y = attr.ib(type=str)
            z = attr.ib()

        assert int is attr.fields(C).x.type
```

The value stored in `attr.fields(C).x.type` is a string "int" instead of a class int.

It seems it was discussed before in https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/424
