slots=True is incompatible with str=True
`slots=True` seems to be incompatible with `str=True`. I discovered this using attrs for exceptions, but it seems true in general:

```pycon
>>> import attr
>>> @attr.s(str=True, slots=True)
... class Foo(object):
...     x = attr.ib()
...
>>> f = Foo(1)
>>> str(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unbound method repr_() must be called with Foo instance as first argument (got nothing instead)
```

Python 2.7.13, attrs==17.2.0
