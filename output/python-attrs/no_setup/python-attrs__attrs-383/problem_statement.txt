Poor error message/type for validators.in_ with a string
```python
import attr

@attr.s
class C:
   s = attr.ib(validator=attr.validators.in_('abc'))

C(s=1)  # TypeError: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not int
```

`__contains__` behaves a little weirdly for strings, but I still think this error could be improved.

Obvious options would be to catch exceptions and re-raise something with a clearer error message, and/or to deprecate use of strings as the collection here.

Found in attrs=18.1.0 while working on HypothesisWorks/hypothesis#954.
