Allow overwriting order inferred from _CountingAttr.counter when passing ordered `these`
attrs classes can be constructed dynamically using `attr.s(maybe_cls=A, these=some_dict)`.
Usually `some_dict` will be a standard (unordered) python dictionary and the order of attributes has to be inferred from `_CountingAttr.counter`.

What about allowing the user to overwrite the `_CountingAttr.counter` by passing an `OrderedDict` as argument to `these`?
