Add option to collect annotated fields
Since I’m sick of hearing that “[PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/) is like attrs, but using variable annotations for field declarations”, I’d like to have an option to collect annotated fields that have no attr.ib definition.

ie.

```python
@attr.s(collect_bare=True)
class C:
    x: int
```

should be equivalent to:

```python
@attr.s
class C:
    x: int = attr.ib()
```

I’m open to better/shorter names.

Volunteers?  @chadrik maybe? :)
