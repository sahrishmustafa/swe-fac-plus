Environment Setup Requirements (for Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Python Version:** The project requires Python >= 3.6. Python 3.9 is a suitable and commonly used version, also covered by `tox.ini` environments.\n*   **Build System Dependencies:** `setuptools` and `wheel` are required by `pyproject.toml`. `build-essential` is needed to compile potential C extensions for packages like `psutil` (a dependency of `pytest-xdist`, which is part of the `[tests]` extra).\n*   **Project Installation:** The project can be installed using `pip install \".[tests]\"`, which installs the core `attrs` package along with all its declared test-specific dependencies from `setup.py` (e.g., `pytest`, `hypothesis`, `pympler`, `mypy`, `pytest-xdist`, `zope.interface`, `cloudpickle`).\n*   **Working Directory:** The root of the repository should be the working directory.\n\n**2. Test Execution Requirements (for Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Test Framework:** `pytest` is the primary test framework used.\n*   **Test Command:** The standard way to run tests is `python -m pytest`. `pyproject.toml` defines default `pytest` options (`-ra --strict-markers --strict-config --xfail-strict` and `filterwarnings`) which `pytest` will automatically apply when run from the root directory.\n*   **Target Test Files:** The specific test file provided is `tests/test_make.py`.\n*   **No Prior Setup:** No explicit database migrations, service startups, or other complex setup steps were identified before running simple unit/integration tests with `pytest`.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
