However, the test log indicates that 7 tests were skipped because they require Python 3.10 or later (e.g., 'Structural pattern matching is 3.10+'). To ensure all relevant tests can be executed, please update the base image to a Python version that supports these features, such as 'python:3.11-slim-buster'. This will provide an environment where all tests in `tests/test_make.py` can potentially run without being skipped due to Python version incompatibility.",
