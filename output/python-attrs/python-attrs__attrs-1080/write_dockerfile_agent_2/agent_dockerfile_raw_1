# 1. Clones the 'attrs' repository into the /testbed/ directory.
# 2. Changes the current directory to /testbed/.
# 3. Resets the repository to the specific commit SHA to ensure reproducibility.
# 4. Installs the core build dependencies (setuptools, wheel) that might be needed by pyproject.toml.
# 5. Installs the 'attrs' project in editable mode, including its 'tests' extra dependencies.
#    This ensures that the project's local code is used and all necessary test dependencies (like pytest) are installed.
