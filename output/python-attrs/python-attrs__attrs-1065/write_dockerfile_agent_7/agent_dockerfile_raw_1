# Base image specification. Defines the foundation OS and architecture for the container.
# Using python:3.10-slim-buster provides Python 3.10 and a slim Debian 10 (Buster) environment.
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# System dependencies installation. Installs essential tools required for cloning the repository and
# building Python packages that might have C extensions (like psutil in pytest-xdist).
# apt update and apt install for git and build-essential, followed by clearing apt lists to reduce image size.
RUN apt update && apt install -y git build-essential && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory inside the container to /testbed/. All subsequent commands will run from this directory.
WORKDIR /testbed/

# Target Project setup.
# 1. Clones the 'attrs' repository into the /testbed/ directory.
# 2. Changes the current directory to /testbed/.
# 3. Resets the repository to the specific commit SHA to ensure reproducibility.
# 4. Installs the core build dependencies (setuptools, wheel).
# 5. Installs the 'attrs' project in editable mode, including its 'tests' and 'cov' extra dependencies.
#    This command pulls in pytest, coverage, mypy (within its compatible range as specified by attrs' setup.py),
#    pytest-mypy-plugins (needed for Python < 3.11 for mypy checks), and other test/dev dependencies.
#    Note: 'mypy' version resolution and installation is handled by 'pip install -e ".[tests,cov]"' based on project's setup.py.
#    'tox' is not installed as the evaluation script directly calls 'pytest' and 'mypy'.
