These errors, such as 'No overload variant of \"define\" matches argument type \"bool\"' and 'Property \"a\" defined in \"Frozen\" is read-only', indicate potential compatibility issues between the `attrs` version 22.1.0/22.2.0.dev0, Python 3.11, and the `mypy` version 0.971-0.989. `attrs` version 22.1.0 was released before Python 3.11's stable release, suggesting possible type stub or runtime inconsistencies. To potentially resolve these type errors, consider changing the base Python version in the Dockerfile from `python:3.11-slim-bullseye` to an earlier, potentially more compatible version for `attrs` 22.1.0, such as `python:3.10-slim-bullseye` or `python:3.9-slim-bullseye`.",

Specifically, look for sections related to type checking (`mypy`) and the Python versions used in those environments for commit `67dc8cc261a5ef64f576ce73f2281cc9021d8fb4`.",
