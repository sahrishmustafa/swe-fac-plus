The log shows `mypy` failures (found 5 errors in 2 files), indicating potential incompatibility or stricter checks with a newer `mypy` version than expected by the tests at commit `67dc8cc261a5ef64f576ce73f2281cc9021d8fb4`. To ensure compatibility with the `attrs` test suite for this specific commit, explicitly pin the `mypy` version after installing `attrs`. Add `&& pip install mypy==0.991` to the end of the last `RUN` command in the Dockerfile. This version is from the `0.9xx` series, aligning well with the `mypy>=0.930` requirement before `mypy 1.0` changes.",
