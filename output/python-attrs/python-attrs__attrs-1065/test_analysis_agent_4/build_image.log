Using dockerfile:
# Base image specification. Defines the foundation OS and architecture for the container.
# Using python:3.11-slim-jammy provides Python 3.11 and a slim Ubuntu 22.04 environment.
FROM python:3.11-slim-jammy

# System dependencies installation. Installs essential tools required for cloning the repository,
# building Python packages that might have C extensions (like psutil), and for Node.js/npm.
# apt update and apt install for git, build-essential, nodejs, npm,
# followed by clearing apt lists to reduce image size.
RUN apt update && apt install -y git build-essential nodejs npm && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory inside the container to /testbed/. All subsequent commands will run from this directory.
WORKDIR /testbed/

# Target Project setup.
# 1. Clones the 'attrs' repository into the /testbed/ directory.
# 2. Changes the current directory to /testbed/.
# 3. Resets the repository to the specific commit SHA to ensure reproducibility.
# 4. Installs the core build dependencies (setuptools, wheel).
# 5. Installs 'tox', the project's test runner, globally.
# 6. Installs the 'attrs' project in editable mode, including its 'tests' and 'cov' extra dependencies.
#    This ensures that the project's local code is used and all necessary test dependencies
#     (like pytest, coverage, nodeenv, mypy, hypothesis, etc.) are installed.
# 7. Explicitly pins the 'mypy' version to 0.991 to resolve compatibility issues with this project's tests
#    at the specified commit, as identified by runtime analysis.
