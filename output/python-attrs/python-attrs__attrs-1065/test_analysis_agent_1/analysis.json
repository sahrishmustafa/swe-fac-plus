  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The `pytest` command incorrectly attempted to collect `tests/dataclass_transform_example.py`. This file contains `reveal_type` calls, which are specific to Mypy and are not recognized by pytest during runtime, leading to a `NameError`. `tests/dataclass_transform_example.py` should be handled by a type checker like Mypy, not pytest. Please modify the evaluation script as follows:\n\n1.  **Remove `tests/dataclass_transform_example.py` from the `pytest` command**: Change `coverage run -m pytest tests/dataclass_transform_example.py tests/test_functional.py -n auto` to `coverage run -m pytest tests/test_functional.py -n auto`.\n2.  **Add `tests/dataclass_transform_example.py` to the `mypy` command**: Change `mypy tests/typing_example.py` to `mypy tests/typing_example.py tests/dataclass_transform_example.py`.\n\nThe Mypy error (Line 107: `No overload variant of \"define\" matches argument type \"bool\"`) reported for `tests/typing_example.py` indicates a legitimate type checking issue within the target test file itself, meaning Mypy executed correctly and found a problem, rather than an environment or execution script issue.",
