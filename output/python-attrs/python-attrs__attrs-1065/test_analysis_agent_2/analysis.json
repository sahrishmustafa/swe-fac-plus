  "guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent": "The `mypy` checks for `tests/dataclass_transform_example.py` and `tests/typing_example.py` failed with type errors (e.g., 'Property \"a\" defined in \"Frozen\" is read-only', 'No overload variant of \"define\" matches argument type \"bool\"'). This typically indicates a version mismatch or incompatibility between the `attrs` library version (22.1 at commit 67dc8cc261a5ef64f576ce73f2281cc9021d8fb4), the installed `mypy` version, or the Python version (3.11). The current Dockerfile installs `mypy` as part of `pip install -e \".[tests,cov]\"`, which might pull in a `mypy` version that is too new or incompatible for the older `attrs` version on Python 3.11. To resolve this, please retrieve the following information from the `python-attrs/attrs` repository at commit `67dc8cc261a5ef64f576ce73f2281cc9021d8fb4`:\n1. Check `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `requirements-test.txt`, or similar dependency specification files for any specific `mypy` version pins or recommended version ranges.\n2. Examine CI configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, `tox.ini`) to determine which exact `mypy` version the project was tested against when using Python 3.11 (if applicable for this commit) or Python 3.x closest to 3.11.",
