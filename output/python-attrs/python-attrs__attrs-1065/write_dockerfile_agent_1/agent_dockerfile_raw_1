# apt update and apt install for git and build-essential, followed by clearing apt lists to reduce image size.

# Target Project setup.
# 1. Clones the 'attrs' repository into the /testbed/ directory.
# 2. Changes the current directory to /testbed/.
# 3. Resets the repository to the specific commit SHA to ensure reproducibility.
# 4. Installs the core build dependencies (setuptools, wheel) explicitly.
# 5. Installs the 'attrs' project in editable mode, including its 'tests' and 'cov' extra dependencies.
#    This ensures that the project's local code is used and all necessary test dependencies
#    (like pytest, coverage, mypy, hypothesis, etc.) are installed.
