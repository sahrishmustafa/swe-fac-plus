No warnings of type (<class 'DeprecationWarning'>, <class 'PendingDeprecationWarning'>, <class 'FutureWarning'>) were emitted.\". This means that while the `AttrsAttributeNotFoundError` was raised as expected by the test, the associated deprecation warning (expected from the `assoc` function, which is marked as deprecated since 17.1.0) was not emitted by the `attrs` library version 22.2.1.dev45. The Dockerfile correctly sets up the environment and the eval script correctly executes the tests; there are no issues with the test execution infrastructure. However, to fully diagnose why this specific test is failing to emit the expected warning and how to proceed, the content of the test patch applied to `tests/test_funcs.py` is needed. Please provide the full content of the test patch that was applied to `tests/test_funcs.py`.",
