The `tox` environment handles installing these by telling `tox` to install the package with these extras. This implies dependencies like `pytest`, `hypothesis`, `zope.interface`, `mypy`, `cloudpickle`, `pympler`, etc., will be handled by `tox`.\n*   **Build System**: `hatchling`. `tox` will likely use this to install the local package.\n*   **Environment Variables**:\n    *   `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=\"99.9.9\"`: Crucial for setting a dummy version during the build process, preventing errors if not building from a proper git tag.\n    *   `FORCE_COLOR=\"1\"`: For colored output.\n    *   `PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=\"1\"` and `PIP_NO_PYTHON_VERSION_WARNING=\"1\"`: To suppress pip warnings.\n    *   `HATCH_BUILD_HOOK_ENABLE_AUTORUN=1`: Possibly needed in some tox environments.\n*   **Test Runner**: `tox` is the primary test runner. It sets up isolated environments and runs `pytest` within them.\n*   **Test Execution Command**:\n    *   To run all tests in a specific Python environment (e.g., `py311`): `python -Im tox run -f py311`\n    *   To run specific test files (e.g., `tests/test_funcs.py`): `python -Im tox run -r -f py311 -- tests/test_funcs.py` (`-r` rebuilds the tox env, good for a fresh container).\n\nThis information is sufficient to create a Dockerfile that sets up the Python environment, installs necessary tools, and an evaluation script that executes the specified test files using `tox`.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
