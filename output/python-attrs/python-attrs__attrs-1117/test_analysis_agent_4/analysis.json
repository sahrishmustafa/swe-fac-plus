This is likely due to the default Python warning filters suppressing `DeprecationWarning` originating from installed packages.\n\nTo resolve this, explicitly configure `pytest` to show deprecation warnings. Modify the test execution command in the `eval` script. Change `-W default` to `-Wd` (which means 'warn for all deprecation warnings') in the `pytest` arguments.\n\n**Current command:**\n```bash\npython -Im tox run -r -f py311 -- -W default tests/test_funcs.py\n```\n**Recommended change:**\n```bash\npython -Im tox run -r -f py311 -- -Wd tests/test_funcs.py\n```",
