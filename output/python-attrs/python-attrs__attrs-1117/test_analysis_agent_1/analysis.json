The log indicates 'Failed: DID NOT WARN. No warnings of type (<class 'DeprecationWarning'>, <class 'PendingDeprecationWarning'>, <class 'FutureWarning'>) were emitted.' Please investigate the `python-attrs/attrs` repository at commit `22ae8473fb88d6e585b05c709e81e1a46398a649` to clarify the intended behavior regarding deprecation warnings for the `assoc` function. Specifically:\n1. Examine the source code of `attr/_funcs.py` and `attr/_deprecate.py` within the specified commit. Confirm whether the `assoc` function is expected to emit a `DeprecationWarning` in `attrs` version 22.2.\n2. If it is expected to emit a warning, check if there are any `pytest` configurations (e.g., in `pyproject.toml` or `conftest.py`) at this commit that might universally suppress `DeprecationWarning`s, or specific `filterwarnings` entries that could interfere with `pytest.deprecated_call()`.",
