simdjson : Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second
===============================================

<img src="images/logo.png" width="10%" style="float: right">
JSON is everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it. We need a fresh
approach. The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms
to parse JSON 4x  faster than RapidJSON and 25x faster than JSON for Modern C++.

* **Fast:** Over 4x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.
* **Record Breaking Features:** Minify JSON  at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8  at 13 GB/s,  NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.
* **Easy:** First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.
* **Strict:** Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
* **Automatic:** Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.
* **Reliable:** From memory allocation to error handling, simdjson's design avoids surprises.
* **Peer Reviewed:** Our research appears in venues like VLDB Journal, Software: Practice and Experience.

This library is part of the [Awesome Modern C++](https://awesomecpp.com) list.

Quick Start
-----------

The simdjson library is easily consumable with a single .h and .cpp file.

0. Prerequisites: `g++` (version 7 or better) or `clang++` (version 6 or better), and a 64-bit
   system with a command-line shell (e.g., Linux, macOS, freeBSD). We also support programming
   environments like Visual Studio and Xcode, but different steps are needed.
1. Pull [simdjson.h](singleheader/simdjson.h) and [simdjson.cpp](singleheader/simdjson.cpp) into a
   directory, along with the sample file [twitter.json](jsonexamples/twitter.json).

   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/jsonexamples/twitter.json
   ```
2. Create `quickstart.cpp`:

```c++
#include "simdjson.h"
using namespace simdjson;
int main(void) {
    ondemand::parser parser;
    padded_string json = padded_string::load("twitter.json");
    ondemand::document tweets = parser.iterate(json);
    std::cout << uint64_t(tweets["search_metadata"]["count"]) << " results." << std::endl;
}

   ```
3. `c++ -o quickstart quickstart.cpp simdjson.cpp`
4. `./quickstart`
   ```
   100 results.
   ```

Documentation
-------------

Usage documentation is available:

* [Basics](doc/basics.md) is an overview of how to use simdjson and its APIs.
* [Performance](doc/performance.md) shows some more advanced scenarios and how to tune for them.
* [Implementation Selection](doc/implementation-selection.md) describes runtime CPU detection and
  how you can work with it.
* [API](https://simdjson.org/api/0.9.0/annotated.html) contains the automatically generated API documentation.

Performance results
-------------------

The simdjson library uses three-quarters less instructions than state-of-the-art parser [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org). To our knowledge, simdjson is the first fully-validating JSON parser
to run at [gigabytes per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) (GB/s) on commodity processors. It can parse millions of JSON documents per second on a single core.

The following figure represents parsing speed in GB/s for parsing various files
on an Intel Skylake processor (3.4 GHz) using the GNU GCC 10 compiler (with the -O3 flag).
We compare against the best and fastest C++ libraries on benchmarks that load and process the data.
The simdjson library offers full unicode ([UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)) validation and exact
number parsing.

<img src="doc/rome.png" width="60%">

The simdjson library offers high speed whether it processes tiny files (e.g., 300 bytes)
or larger files (e.g., 3MB). The following plot presents parsing
speed for [synthetic files over various sizes generated with a script](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019/blob/master/experiments/growing/gen.py) on a 3.4 GHz Skylake processor (GNU GCC 9, -O3).

<img src="doc/growing.png" width="60%">

[All our experiments are reproducible](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019).


For NDJSON files, we can exceed 3 GB/s with [our  multithreaded parsing functions](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/parse_many.md).

About simdjson
--------------

The simdjson library takes advantage of modern microarchitectures, parallelizing with SIMD vector
instructions, reducing branch misprediction, and reducing data dependency to take advantage of each
CPU's multiple execution cores.

Some people [enjoy reading our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318): A description of the design
and implementation of simdjson is in our research article:
- Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, [Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318), VLDB Journal 28 (6), 2019.

We have an in-depth paper focused on the UTF-8 validation:

- John Keiser, Daniel Lemire, [Validating UTF-8 In Less Than One Instruction Per Byte](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03090), Software: Practice & Experience 51 (5), 2021.

We also have an informal [blog post providing some background and context](https://branchfree.org/2019/02/25/paper-parsing-gigabytes-of-json-per-second/).

============

The simdjson library is an open project written in C++. Contributions are invited. Contributors
agree to the project's license.

We have an extensive list of issues, and contributions toward any of these issues is invited.
Contributions can take the form of code samples, better documentation or design ideas.

In particular, the following contributions are invited:

- The library is focused on performance. Well-documented performance optimization are invited.
- Fixes to known or newly discovered bugs are always welcome. Typically, a bug fix should come with
  a test demonstrating that the bug has been fixed.
- The simdjson library is advanced software and maintainability and flexibility are always a
  concern. Specific contributions to improve maintainability and flexibility are invited.

We discourage the following types of contributions:

- Code refactoring. We all have our preferences as to how code should be written, but unnecessary
  refactoring can waste time and introduce new bugs. If you believe that refactoring is needed, you
  first must explain how it helps in concrete terms. Does it improve the performance?
- Applications of new language features for their own sake. Using advanced C++ language constructs
  is actually a negative as it may reduce portability (to old compilers, old standard libraries and
  systems) and reduce accessibility (to programmers that have not kept up), so it must be offsetted
  by clear gains like performance or maintainability. When in doubt, avoid advanced C++ features
  (beyond C++11).
- Style formatting. In general, please abstain from reformatting code just to make it look prettier.
  Though code formatting is important, it can also be a waste of time if several contributors try to
  tweak the code base toward their own preference. Please do not introduce unneeded white-space
  changes.

In short, most code changes should either bring new features or better performance. We want to avoid unmotivated code changes.


Specific rules
----------

We have few hard rules, but we have some:

- Printing to standard output or standard error (`stderr`, `stdout`, `std::cerr`, `std::cout`) in the core library is forbidden. This follows from the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual which states that "Compiled code should not write to stdout or stderr".
- Calls to `abort()` are forbidden in the core library. This follows from the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual which states that "Under no circumstances should your compiled code ever call abort or exit".
- All source code files (.h, .cpp) must be ASCII.
- All C macros introduced in public headers need to be prefixed with either `SIMDJSON_` or `simdjson_`.
- We avoid trailing white space characters within lines. That is, your lines of code should not terminate with unnecessary spaces. Generally, please avoid making unnecessary changes to white-space characters when contributing code.

Tools, tests and benchmarks are not held to these same strict rules.

General Guidelines
----------

Contributors are encouraged to :

- Document their changes. Though we do not enforce a rule regarding code comments, we prefer that non-trivial algorithms and techniques be somewhat documented in the code.
- Follow as much as possible the existing code style. We do not enforce a specific code style, but we prefer consistency.
- Modify as few lines of code as possible when working on an issue. The more lines you modify, the harder it is for your fellow human beings to understand what is going on.
- Tools may report "problems" with the code, but we never delegate programming to tools: if there is a problem with the code, we need to understand it. Thus we will not "fix" code merely to please a static analyzer if we do not understand.
- Provide tests for any new feature. We will not merge a new feature without tests.

Pull Requests
--------------

Pull requests are always invited. However, we ask that you follow these guidelines:

- It is wiser to discuss your ideas first as part of an issue before you start coding. If you omit this step and code first, be prepare to have your code receive scrutiny and be dropped.
- Users should provide a rationale for their changes. Does it improve performance? Does it add a feature? Does it improve maintainability? Does fix a bug? This must be explicitly stated as part of the pull request. Do not propose changes based on taste or intuition. We do not delegate programming to tools: that some tool suggested a code change is not reason enough to change the code.
   1. When your code improves performance, please document the gains with a benchmark using hard numbers.
   2. If your code fixes a bug, please be either fix a failing test, or propose a new test.
   3. Other types of changes must be clearly motivated. We openly discourage changes with no identifiable benefits.
- Changes should be focused and minimal. You should change as few lines of code as possible. Please do not reformat or touch files needlessly.
- New features must be accompanied of new tests, in general.
- Your code should pass our continuous-integration tests. It is your responsibility to ensure that your proposal pass the tests. We do not merge pull requests that would break our build.
   - An exception to this would be changes to non-code files, such as documentation and assets, or trivial changes to code, such as comments, where it is encouraged to explicitly ask for skipping a CI run using the `[skip ci]` prefix in your Pull Request title **and** in the first line of the most recent commit in a push. Example for such a commit: `[skip ci] Fixed typo in power_of_ten's docs`
   This benefits the project in such a way that the CI pipeline is not burdened by running jobs on changes that don't change any behavior in the code, which reduces wait times for other Pull Requests that do change behavior and require testing.

If the benefits of your proposed code remain unclear, we may choose to discard your code: that is not an insult, we frequently discard our own code. We may also consider various alternatives and choose another path. Again, that is not an insult or a sign that you have wasted your time.

Style
-----

Our formatting style is inspired by the LLVM style.
The simdjson library is written using the snake case: when a variable or a function is a phrase,  each space is replaced by an underscore character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.  Compile-time constants are written entirely in uppercase with the same underscore convention.

Code of Conduct
---------------

Though we do not have a formal code of conduct, we will not tolerate bullying, bigotry or
intimidation. Everyone is welcome to contribute. If you have concerns, you can raise them privately with the core team members (e.g., D. Lemire, J. Keiser).

We welcome contributions from women and less represented groups. If you need help, please reach out.

Consider the following points when engaging with the project:

- We discourage arguments from authority: ideas are discusssed on their own merits and not based on who stated it.
- Be mindful that what you may view as an aggression is maybe merely a difference of opinion or a misunderstanding.
- Be mindful that a collection of small aggressions, even if mild in isolation, can become harmful.

================

Here is wisdom about how to build, test and run simdjson from within the repository. This is mostly useful for people who plan to contribute simdjson, or maybe study the design.

If you plan to contribute to simdjson, please read our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.


Design notes
------------------------------

The parser works in two stages:

- Stage 1. (Find marks) Identifies quickly structure elements, strings, and so forth. We validate UTF-8 encoding at that stage.
- Stage 2. (Structure building) Involves constructing a "tree" of sort (materialized as a tape) to navigate through the data. Strings and numbers are parsed at this stage.


The role of stage 1 is to identify pseudo-structural characters as quickly as possible. A character is pseudo-structural if and only if:

1. Not enclosed in quotes, AND
2. Is a non-whitespace character, AND
3. Its preceding character is either:
   (a) a structural character, OR
   (b) whitespace OR
   (c) the final quote in a string.

This helps as we redefine some new characters as pseudo-structural such as the characters 1, G, n in the following:

> { "foo" : 1.5, "bar" : 1.5 GEOFF_IS_A_DUMMY bla bla , "baz", null }

Stage 1 also does unicode validation.

Stage 2 handles all of the rest: number parsings, recognizing atoms like true, false, null, and so forth.

Developer mode
--------------

Build system targets that are only useful for developers of the simdjson
library are behind the `SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE` option. Enabling this option
makes tests, examples, benchmarks and other developer targets available. Not
enabling this option means that you are a consumer of simdjson and thus you
only get the library targets and options.

Developer mode is forced to be on when the `CI` environment variable is set to
a value that CMake recognizes as "on", which is set to `true` in all of the CI
workflows used by simdjson.

Directory Structure and Source
------------------------------

simdjson's source structure, from the top level, looks like this:

* **CMakeLists.txt:** The main build system.
* **include:** User-facing declarations and inline definitions (most user-facing functions are inlined).
  * simdjson.h: A "main include" that includes files from include/simdjson/. This is equivalent to
    the distributed simdjson.h.
  * simdjson/*.h: Declarations for public simdjson classes and functions.
  * simdjson/*-inl.h: Definitions for public simdjson classes and functions.
* **src:** The source files for non-inlined functionality (e.g. the architecture-specific parser
  implementations).
  * simdjson.cpp: A "main source" that includes all implementation files from src/. This is
    equivalent to the distributed simdjson.cpp.
  * arm64/|fallback/|haswell/|ppc64/|westmere/: Architecture-specific implementations. All functions are
    Each architecture defines its own namespace, e.g. simdjson::haswell.
  * generic/: Generic implementations of the simdjson parser. These files may be included and
    compiled multiple times, from whichever architectures use them. They assume they are already
    enclosed in a namespace, e.g.:
    ```c++
    namespace simdjson {
      namespace haswell {
        #include "generic/stage1/json_structural_indexer.h"
      }
    }
    ```

Other important files and directories:
* **.drone.yml:** Definitions for Drone CI.
* **.appveyor.yml:** Definitions for Appveyor CI (Windows).
* **.circleci:** Definitions for Circle CI.
* **.github/workflows:** Definitions for GitHub Actions (CI).
* **singleheader:** Contains generated `simdjson.h` and `simdjson.cpp` that we release. The files `singleheader/simdjson.h` and `singleheader/simdjson.cpp` should never be edited by hand.
* **singleheader/amalgamate.py:** Generates `singleheader/simdjson.h` and `singleheader/simdjson.cpp` for release (python script).
* **benchmark:** This is where we do benchmarking. Benchmarking is core to every change we make; the
  cardinal rule is don't regress performance without knowing exactly why, and what you're trading
  for it. Many of our benchmarks are microbenchmarks. We are effectively doing controlled scientific experiments for the purpose of understanding what affects our performance. So we simplify as much as possible. We try to avoid irrelevant factors such as page faults, interrupts, unnnecessary system calls. We recommend checking the performance as follows:
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
  cmake --build . --config Release
  benchmark/dom/parse ../jsonexamples/twitter.json
  ```
  The last line becomes `./benchmark/Release/parse.exe ../jsonexample/twitter.json` under Windows. You may also use Google Benchmark:
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
  cmake --build . --target bench_parse_call --config Release
  ./benchmark/bench_parse_call
  ```
  The last line becomes `./benchmark/Release/bench_parse_call.exe` under Windows. Under Windows, you can also build with the clang compiler by adding `-T ClangCL` to the call to `cmake ..`: `cmake -T ClangCL ..`.

  * `json2json mydoc.json` parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps back the result to standard output.
  * `json2json -d mydoc.json` parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps model (as a tape) to standard output. The tape format is described in the accompanying file `tape.md`.
  * `minify mydoc.json` minifies the JSON document, outputting the result to standard output. Minifying means to remove the unneeded white space characters.
  *`jsonpointer mydoc.json <jsonpath> <jsonpath> ... <jsonpath>` parses the document, constructs a model and then processes a series of [JSON Pointer paths](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901). The result is itself a JSON document.


> **Don't modify the files in singleheader/ directly; these are automatically generated.**


While simdjson distributes just two files from the singleheader/ directory, we *maintain* the code in
multiple files under include/ and src/. The files include/simdjson.h and src/simdjson.cpp are the "spine" for
these, and you can include them as if they were the corresponding singleheader/ files.



Runtime Dispatching
--------------------

A key feature of simdjson is the ability to compile different processing kernels, optimized for specific instruction sets, and to select
the most appropriate kernel at runtime. This ensures that users get the very best performance while still enabling simdjson to run everywhere.
This technique is frequently called runtime dispatching. The simdjson achieves runtime dispatching entirely in C++: we do not assume
that the user is building the code using CMake, for example.

To make runtime dispatching work, it is critical that the code be compiled for the lowest supported processor. In particular, you should
not use flags such as -mavx2, /arch:AVX2 and so forth while compiling simdjson. When you do so, you allow the compiler to use advanced
instructions. In turn, these advanced instructions present in the code may cause a runtime failure if the runtime processor does not
support them. Even a simple loop, compiled with these flags, might generate binary code that only run on advanced processors.

So we compile simdjson for a generic processor. Our users should do the same if they want simdjson's runtime dispatch to work. It is important
to understand that if runtime dispatching does not work, then simdjson will cause crashes on older processors. Of course, if a user chooses
to compile their code for a specific instruction set (e.g., AVX2), they are responsible for the failures if they later run their code
on a processor that does not support AVX2. Yet, if we were to entice these users to do so, we would share the blame: thus we carefully instruct
users to compile their code in a generic way without doing anything to enable advanced instructions.


We only use runtime dispatching on x64 (AMD/Intel) platforms, at the moment. On ARM processors, we would need a standard way to query, at runtime,
the processor for its supported features. We do not know how to do so on ARM systems in general. Thankfully it is not yet a concern: 64-bit ARM
processors are fairly uniform as far as the instruction sets they support.


In all cases, simdjson uses advanced instructions by relying on  "intrinsic functions": we do not write assembly code. The intrinsic functions
are special functions that the compiler might recognize and translate into fast code. To make runtime dispatching work, we rely on the fact that
the header providing these instructions
(intrin.h under Visual Studio, x86intrin.h elsewhere) defines all of the intrinsic functions, including those that are not supported
processor.

At this point, we are require to use one of two main strategies.

1. On POSIX systems, the main compilers (LLVM clang, GNU gcc) allow us to use any intrinsic function after including the header, but they fail to inline the resulting instruction if the target processor does not support them. Because we compile for a generic processor, we would not be able to use most intrinsic functions. Thankfully, more recent versions of these compilers allow us to flag a region of code with a specific target, so that we can compile only some of the code with support for advanced instructions. Thus in our C++, one might notice macros like `TARGET_HASWELL`. It is then our responsibility, at runtime, to only run the regions of code (that we call kernels) matching the properties of the runtime processor. The benefit of this approach is that the compiler not only let us use intrinsic functions, but it can also optimize the rest of the code in the kernel with advanced instructions we enabled.

2. Under Visual Studio, the problem is somewhat simpler. Visual Studio will not only provide the intrinsic functions, but it will also allow us to use them. They will compile just fine. It is at runtime that they may cause a crash. So we do not need to mark regions of code for compilation toward advanced processors (e.g., with  `TARGET_HASWELL` macros). The downside of the Visual Studio approach is that the compiler is not allowed to use advanced instructions others than those we specify. In principle, this means that Visual Studio has weaker optimization opportunities.



We also handle the special case where a user is compiling using LLVM clang under Windows, [using the Visual Studio toolchain](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clang-llvm-support-in-visual-studio/). If you compile with LLVM clang under Visual Studio, then the header files (intrin.h or x86intrin.h) no longer provides the intrinsic functions that are unsupported by the processor. This appears to be deliberate on the part of the LLVM engineers. With a few lines of code, we handle this scenario just like LLVM clang under a POSIX system, but forcing the inclusion of the specific headers, and rolling our own intrinsic function as needed.





Regenerating Single-Header Files
---------------------------------------

The simdjson.h and simdjson.cpp files in the singleheader directory are not always up-to-date with the rest of the code; they are only ever
systematically regenerated on releases. To ensure you have the latest code, you can regenerate them by running this at the top level:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
cmake --build . # needed, because currently dependencies do not work fully for the amalgamate target
cmake --build . --target amalgamate
```

You need to have python3 installed on your system.

The amalgamator script `amalgamate.py` generates singleheader/simdjson.h by
reading through include/simdjson.h, copy/pasting each header file into the amalgamated file at the
point it gets included (but only once per header). singleheader/simdjson.cpp is generated from
src/simdjson.cpp the same way, except files under generic/ may be included and copy/pasted multiple
times.

### Usage (CMake on 64-bit platforms like Linux, FreeBSD or macOS)

Requirements: In addition to git, we require a recent version of CMake as well as bash.

1. On macOS, the easiest way to install cmake might be to use [brew](https://brew.sh) and then type
```
brew install cmake
```
2. Under Linux, you might be able to install CMake as follows:
```
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install -y cmake
```
3. On FreeBSD, you might be able to install bash and CMake as follows:
```
pkg update -f
pkg install bash
pkg install cmake
```

You need a recent compiler like clang or gcc. We recommend at least GNU GCC/G++ 7 or LLVM clang 6.


Building: While in the project repository, do the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

CMake will build a library. By default, it builds a static library (e.g., libsimdjson.a on Linux).

You can build a shared library:

```
mkdir buildshared
cd buildshared
cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

In some cases, you may want to specify your compiler, especially if the default compiler on your system is too old.  You need to tell cmake which compiler you wish to use by setting the CC and CXX variables. Under bash, you can do so with commands such as `export CC=gcc-7` and `export CXX=g++-7`. You can also do it as part of the `cmake` command: `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ ..`.  You may proceed as follows:

```
brew install gcc@8
mkdir build
cd build
export CXX=g++-8 CC=gcc-8
cmake -D SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

If your compiler does not default on C++11 support or better you may get failing tests. If so, you may be able to exclude the failing  tests by replacing `ctest` with `ctest  -E "^quickstart$"`.

Note that the name of directory (`build`) is arbitrary, you can name it as you want (e.g., `buildgcc`) and you can have as many different such directories as you would like (one per configuration).



### Usage (CMake on 64-bit Windows using Visual Studio 2019)

We assume you have a common 64-bit Windows PC with at least Visual Studio 2019.

- Grab the simdjson code from GitHub, e.g., by cloning it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). When you install it, make sure to ask that `cmake` be made available from the command line. Please choose a recent version of cmake.
- Create a subdirectory within simdjson, such as `build`.
- Using a shell, go to this newly created directory. You can start a shell directly from GitHub Desktop (Repository > Open in Command Prompt).
- Type `cmake  ..` in the shell while in the `build` repository.
- This last command (`cmake ...`) created a Visual Studio solution file in the newly created directory (e.g., `simdjson.sln`). Open this file in Visual Studio. You should now be able to build the project and run the tests. For example, in the `Solution Explorer` window (available from the `View` menu), right-click `ALL_BUILD` and select `Build`. To test the code, still in the `Solution Explorer` window, select `RUN_TESTS` and select `Build`.


Though having Visual Studio installed is necessary, one can build simdjson using only cmake commands:

- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `cmake --build . -config Release`


Furthermore, if you have installed LLVM clang on Windows, for example as a component of Visual Studio 2019, you can configure and build simdjson using LLVM clang on Windows using cmake:


- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake -T ClangCL ..`
- `cmake --build . -config Release`

However, the eval script uses `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` for the rebuild after applying the patch. On this system, `nproc` appears to be 12, which is likely causing the resource exhaustion.\n\n**Action:** Modify the `eval_script`. Change the line `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` to `cmake --build . -j4` to match the more conservative and successful approach used in the Dockerfile. This will limit memory usage during the rebuild and should allow the compilation to complete, enabling the `ctest` command to run.",
