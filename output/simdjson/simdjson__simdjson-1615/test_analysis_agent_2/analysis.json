This typically indicates that the compilation process ran out of memory or other resources because `-j$(nproc)` attempts to use all available CPU cores, which can be very resource-intensive for large C++ projects in a constrained Docker build environment.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to limit the number of parallel compilation jobs during the build phase in the Dockerfile. Modify the `cmake --build` command to use a fixed, lower number of cores instead of `$(nproc)`:\n\nChange this line:\n`cmake --build . -j$(nproc)`\n\nTo:\n`cmake --build . -j4` (or `j2` if `j4` still leads to resource exhaustion issues). Setting it to `j4` is a reasonable starting point to reduce memory consumption while still benefiting from some parallelism.",
