The compilation errors occurred in the `benchmark/dom/CMakeFiles/parse.dir/parse.cpp.o` source file, with messages such as `#error Unknown SIMDJSON_BUILTIN_IMPLEMENTATION` and related issues with 'OFF' being treated as a namespace. These errors are caused by the `checkperf-reference` sub-project within the `benchmark` directory, which is non-essential for running the target tests.\n\nTo resolve this, modify the `cmake` configuration command in the Dockerfile (Step 8) to explicitly disable building the benchmarks. Add `-DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` to the `cmake -S . -B build` command.\n\nHere's the corrected Dockerfile line:\n`RUN mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF && cmake --build build`",
