The `cmake` command `SIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` was incorrectly set, as indicated by the CMake warning: \"Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: SIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS\".\n\nFor `simdjson` v0.2.1 (corresponding to commit c96ff018fedc7fe087b6f898442458a31a240a28), the correct CMake option to disable benchmarks is `BUILD_BENCHMARKS`.\nAdditionally, the build log shows errors during the compilation of `checkperf-reference` related targets (e.g., `benchmark/dom/CMakeFiles/parse.dir/parse.cpp.o`), which are typically enabled by `SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE`.\n\n**Action:** Modify the `cmake` command in the `Dockerfile` to explicitly disable benchmarks and developer mode.\n\n**Before:**\n```dockerfile\nRUN mkdir build && \\\n    cmake -S . -B build -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF && \\\n    cmake --build build\n```\n**After:**\n```dockerfile\nRUN mkdir build && \\\n    cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF -DSIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=OFF && \\\n    cmake --build build\n```\nThis change should prevent the compilation of benchmarks and related `checkperf` targets, allowing the Dockerfile to build successfully.",
