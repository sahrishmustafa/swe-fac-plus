  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed because the `cmake --build build` step encountered compilation errors related to benchmark targets, specifically within the `checkperf-reference/master` subdirectory. Although `SIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` was passed, CMake warned that this variable was not used. The root cause appears to be that for this version (0.8), this flag is not sufficient to prevent the building of all benchmark-related components, especially the `checkperf` targets which are conditionally added and try to re-clone / build the repo's master branch within a sub-directory, leading to the C++ compilation errors like '#error Unknown SIMDJSON_BUILTIN_IMPLEMENTATION' and issues related to 'OFF' being misinterpreted as a namespace.\n\nTo fix this, modify the `cmake` command in the Dockerfile (Step 8/8) to explicitly disable the `checkperf` version comparison and building by adding the flag `-DSIMDJSON_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECKPERF=ON`. This flag is designed to prevent the problematic `checkperf` sub-project from being built.\n\nChange the `RUN` command in Step 8/8 from:\n`RUN mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF && cmake --build build`\nTo:\n`RUN mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF -DSIMDJSON_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECKPERF=ON && cmake --build build`\n\nThis should prevent the build from attempting to compile the troublesome benchmark components and allow the Dockerfile to build successfully, enabling the eval script to run.",
