The build log shows crucial warnings: `CMake Warning: Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: BUILD_BENCHMARKS SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE`. These warnings indicate that the CMake flags `-DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` and `-DSIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=OFF` provided in the Dockerfile's `cmake` command are not recognized by the project's CMake configuration for this version (0.8, commit c96ff018fedc7fe087b6f898442458a31a240a28) of simdjson. \n\nConsequently, the build proceeds to compile benchmark components (specifically, within `checkperf-reference`), leading to compilation errors such as `#error Unknown SIMDJSON_BUILTIN_IMPLEMENTATION` and `'OFF' is not a namespace-name` where the macros expect a valid implementation name, not 'OFF'.\n\nTo fix this, the Dockerfile needs to use the correct CMake variable to disable the building of benchmarks. For `simdjson`, the correct flag is `SIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS`. Please update the Dockerfile's build command to use `SIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` instead of `BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF`.",
