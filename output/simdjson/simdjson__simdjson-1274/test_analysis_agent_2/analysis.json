Specifically, CMake reported an error: 'INTERFACE_LIBRARY targets may only have whitelisted properties. The property \"POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\" is not allowed.' This error occurs because the `SIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS` option, which is set to `ON`, triggers the configuration of the Google Benchmark project and other related `checkperf` targets, leading to this specific CMake incompatibility with `INTERFACE_LIBRARY` targets and the `POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property. Since the target tests (`tests/ondemand/ondemand_basictests.cpp`) are standard unit tests and do not rely on benchmarking features, it is safe to disable this option. To resolve this build failure, modify the Dockerfile's CMake command to set `SIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS` to `OFF`.\n\n**Action:** In `Step 9/9`, change the line:\n`        -DSIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS=ON \\`\nto:\n`        -DSIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS=OFF \\`",
