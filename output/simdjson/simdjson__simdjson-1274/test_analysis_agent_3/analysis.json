  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the 'make' step (Step 9/9) because of a CMake error related to `checkperf` targets. Specifically, the error `INTERFACE_LIBRARY targets may only have whitelisted properties. The property \"POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\" is not allowed.` occurred while building `benchmark/CMakeFiles/checkperf-parse`. Although the target test `ondemand_basictests` was successfully compiled, the overall 'make' command failed, preventing the Dockerfile from building successfully and thus the evaluation script from running.\n\nTo resolve this, explicitly disable unnecessary build components in the CMake configuration. Update the 'cmake' command in the Dockerfile as follows:\n\nOriginal CMake command:\n```cmake\ncmake \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS=OFF \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=ON \\\n        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local \\\n        ..\n```\n\nModified CMake command (add flags to disable benchmarks, tools, and examples to prevent problematic optional components from building):\n```cmake\ncmake \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_GOOGLE_BENCHMARKS=OFF \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=ON \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF \\\n        -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \\\n        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local \\\n        ..\n```\n\nThese additional flags should prevent the problematic `checkperf` targets and other non-essential components from being built, allowing the Dockerfile build to complete successfully.",
