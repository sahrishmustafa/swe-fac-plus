This indicates that the compiler ran out of memory or other resources during compilation, likely due to using too many parallel jobs. To fix this, modify the `make` command in the Dockerfile from `make -j$(nproc)` to `make` (which will use a default or single job) or `make -j<lower_number_of_cores>` (e.g., `make -j2`) to reduce resource contention during compilation. Given the project's complexity and number of submodules, reducing parallelism is crucial.",
