This happened because the `make -j$(nproc)` command in the eval script attempted to build all targets with excessive parallelism, unlike the more restricted initial build in the Dockerfile. To fix this:\n1. Modify the `make` command in the eval script's rebuild step to limit parallelism (e.g., to `-j2` or `-j1`) to prevent Out Of Memory (OOM) errors.\n2. Ensure the `make` command for the rebuild explicitly builds only the necessary targets: `simdjson` and `ondemand_basictests`, similar to how they were built in the Dockerfile's initial build step. This will prevent compilation of unneeded and potentially memory-intensive components like fuzzers or examples.\n\nChange the line:\n`make -j$(nproc)`\nTo:\n`make -j2 simdjson ondemand_basictests`",
