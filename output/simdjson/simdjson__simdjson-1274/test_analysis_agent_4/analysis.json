  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make -j2` step with a 'CMake Error' related to 'INTERFACE_LIBRARY targets' and specifically targeting 'checkperf-parse', which is a benchmark component. The CMake flags `-DSIMDJSON_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF`, `-DSIMDJSON_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF`, and `-DSIMDJSON_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` were not respected by the project's CMake configuration, as indicated by the 'Manually-specified variables were not used by the project' warning.\n\nWhile the specific `ondemand_basictests` executable was built, the overall `make all` command failed. To resolve this, modify the `make` command in the Dockerfile (Step 9) to explicitly build only the required targets: the `simdjson` library and the `ondemand_basictests` test executable. This will bypass the problematic benchmark targets.\n\n**Action:**\n- In the `Dockerfile`, locate the last `RUN` instruction (Step 9) for `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ... && make -j2`.\n- Change the `make` line from `make -j2` to `make -j2 simdjson ondemand_basictests`.",
