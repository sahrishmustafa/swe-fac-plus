This typically indicates an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issue when compiling. To resolve this, modify the Dockerfile to limit the number of parallel compilation jobs. Change `cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` to `cmake --build . -j4` (or even `-j2` if `-j4` is still too high for the available memory) in Step 9. This will reduce memory consumption during the build process, allowing it to complete successfully. The `eval_script` already uses `-j4`, so the Dockerfile should align with that for the initial build.",
