This indicates a compatibility issue where the installed CMake version is too new to implicitly support the old CMake policy version requested by a sub-dependency's `CMakeLists.txt`.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to explicitly set the minimum policy version for CMake during the configuration of the `simdjson` project.\n\n**Action:** Modify the `cmake` command in `Step 9/10` of your Dockerfile.\n\n**Current line:**\n`cmake .. -DSIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON`\n\n**Change to:**\n`cmake .. -DSIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`\n\nThis flag will instruct CMake to configure the project using policies compatible with CMake version 3.5, thereby bypassing the error related to the outdated `cmake_minimum_required` statement in the `cxxopts` dependency.",
