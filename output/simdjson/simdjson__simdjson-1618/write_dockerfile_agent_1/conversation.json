        "content": "Generate a **Dockerfile** based on the collected environment setup information.  \nThe Dockerfile must ensure that the provided test files can be executed correctly.\n\n### **Requirements:**\n1. **Clone the repository** inside the Docker container into `/testbed/` and set `WORKDIR` to `/testbed/`.\n2. **Checkout a specific commit SHA**, which will be provided by the user.\n3. **Set up the environment** based on the information from the context retrieval agent:\n   - Install necessary system dependencies and programming language versions.\n   - Set up a virtual environment (`testbed`) if required.\n   - Install all necessary libraries and dependencies.\n4. **Ensure test execution** by setting up all necessary configurations.\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. You are FORBIDDEN to run tests in the dockerfile, tests will be run using eval script.\n2. When building the Dockerfile, you MUST prioritize using package managers such as Conda, Maven, or NPM etc to set up the environment efficiently.\n3. Ensure shell compatibility by using `/bin/bash` as the default shell environment to avoid runtime issues.  For example, **do not use `FROM alpine:latest`**, as it lacks `/bin/bash` by default, which may cause runtime errors. Instead, use a base image like `ubuntu:22.04` or `debian:bookworm` that includes Bash by default.\n4. Pay more attention when using Ubuntu-based images**, as different versions may have variations in default packages, dependency resolution, and package manager behavior, which could lead to unexpected errors.\n5. DO NOT use `COPY` to copy local files** into the Docker container.  \n   - For example, avoid using `COPY package.json /testbed/` or `COPY requirements.txt /testbed/`.  \n   - Instead, all files should be retrieved directly by **cloning the repository** inside the container to ensure a fully reproducible environment.\n6. DO NOT run tests in the Dockerfile**.  \n   - Do not include commands like `npm test`, `pytest`, or `mvn test` in the Dockerfile.  \n   - Tests will be executed separately, and running them during the Docker build stage is an unnecessary overhead.\n   - You can skip tests during environment setup because this is not your job.\n\n7. If there is a reference Dockerfile, use it as a guideline.   \n8. Do not use ENTRYPOINT.\n9. Please install necessary essential tools and libraries required for development and runtime, such as git etc.\n10. When setting up dependencies for the target repository (e.g., `torch 3.33`), **DO NOT** install the package directly from external registries (e.g., PyPI, NPM, Maven Central) using commands like `pip install <package>` (e.g., `pip install torch`).  \n   Instead, **you can install the repository itself in development mode** (`pip install -e .` for Python, `npm link` for Node.js, or `mvn install` for Java) to ensure that the local repository\u2019s code is correctly referenced during execution.\n   **Why is this important?**  \n   - If you modify the repository\u2019s source code but have already installed a pre-built package from the registry, your system may load the installed package instead of your local code, **leading to incorrect test results and making debugging difficult**.  \n   - Using development mode installation (`pip install -e .`, `npm link`, `mvn install`) ensures that the system always references the latest local repository code, preventing version mismatches and ensuring that modifications are properly reflected in subsequent tests.\n\n\n\n### **Example Format:**\nThe Dockerfile must be wrapped in `<dockerfile>` tags.
