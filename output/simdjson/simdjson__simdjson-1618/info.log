simdjson : Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second
===============================================

<img src="images/logo.png" width="10%" style="float: right">
JSON is everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it. We need a fresh
approach. The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms
to parse JSON 4x  faster than RapidJSON and 25x faster than JSON for Modern C++.

* **Fast:** Over 4x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.
* **Record Breaking Features:** Minify JSON  at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8  at 13 GB/s,  NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.
* **Easy:** First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.
* **Strict:** Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
* **Automatic:** Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.
* **Reliable:** From memory allocation to error handling, simdjson's design avoids surprises.
* **Peer Reviewed:** Our research appears in venues like VLDB Journal, Software: Practice and Experience.

This library is part of the [Awesome Modern C++](https://awesomecpp.com) list.

Quick Start
-----------

The simdjson library is easily consumable with a single .h and .cpp file.

0. Prerequisites: `g++` (version 7 or better) or `clang++` (version 6 or better), and a 64-bit
   system with a command-line shell (e.g., Linux, macOS, freeBSD). We also support programming
   environments like Visual Studio and Xcode, but different steps are needed.
1. Pull [simdjson.h](singleheader/simdjson.h) and [simdjson.cpp](singleheader/simdjson.cpp) into a
   directory, along with the sample file [twitter.json](jsonexamples/twitter.json).

   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/jsonexamples/twitter.json
   ```
2. Create `quickstart.cpp`:

```c++
#include "simdjson.h"
using namespace simdjson;
int main(void) {
    ondemand::parser parser;
    padded_string json = padded_string::load("twitter.json");
    ondemand::document tweets = parser.iterate(json);
    std::cout << uint64_t(tweets["search_metadata"]["count"]) << " results." << std::endl;
}

   ```
3. `c++ -o quickstart quickstart.cpp simdjson.cpp`
4. `./quickstart`
   ```
   100 results.
   ```

Documentation
-------------

Usage documentation is available:

* [Basics](doc/basics.md) is an overview of how to use simdjson and its APIs.
* [Performance](doc/performance.md) shows some more advanced scenarios and how to tune for them.
* [Implementation Selection](doc/implementation-selection.md) describes runtime CPU detection and
  how you can work with it.
* [API](https://simdjson.org/api/0.9.0/annotated.html) contains the automatically generated API documentation.

Performance results
-------------------

The simdjson library uses three-quarters less instructions than state-of-the-art parser [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org). To our knowledge, simdjson is the first fully-validating JSON parser
to run at [gigabytes per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) (GB/s) on commodity processors. It can parse millions of JSON documents per second on a single core.

The following figure represents parsing speed in GB/s for parsing various files
on an Intel Skylake processor (3.4 GHz) using the GNU GCC 10 compiler (with the -O3 flag).
We compare against the best and fastest C++ libraries on benchmarks that load and process the data.
The simdjson library offers full unicode ([UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)) validation and exact
number parsing.

<img src="doc/rome.png" width="60%">

The simdjson library offers high speed whether it processes tiny files (e.g., 300 bytes)
or larger files (e.g., 3MB). The following plot presents parsing
speed for [synthetic files over various sizes generated with a script](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019/blob/master/experiments/growing/gen.py) on a 3.4 GHz Skylake processor (GNU GCC 9, -O3).

<img src="doc/growing.png" width="60%">

[All our experiments are reproducible](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019).


For NDJSON files, we can exceed 3 GB/s with [our  multithreaded parsing functions](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/parse_many.md).

About simdjson
--------------

The simdjson library takes advantage of modern microarchitectures, parallelizing with SIMD vector
instructions, reducing branch misprediction, and reducing data dependency to take advantage of each
CPU's multiple execution cores.

Some people [enjoy reading our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318): A description of the design
and implementation of simdjson is in our research article:
- Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, [Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318), VLDB Journal 28 (6), 2019.

We have an in-depth paper focused on the UTF-8 validation:

- John Keiser, Daniel Lemire, [Validating UTF-8 In Less Than One Instruction Per Byte](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03090), Software: Practice & Experience 51 (5), 2021.

We also have an informal [blog post providing some background and context](https://branchfree.org/2019/02/25/paper-parsing-gigabytes-of-json-per-second/).

============

The simdjson library is an open project written in C++. Contributions are invited. Contributors
agree to the project's license.

We have an extensive list of issues, and contributions toward any of these issues is invited.
Contributions can take the form of code samples, better documentation or design ideas.

In particular, the following contributions are invited:

- The library is focused on performance. Well-documented performance optimization are invited.
- Fixes to known or newly discovered bugs are always welcome. Typically, a bug fix should come with
  a test demonstrating that the bug has been fixed.
- The simdjson library is advanced software and maintainability and flexibility are always a
  concern. Specific contributions to improve maintainability and flexibility are invited.

We discourage the following types of contributions:

- Code refactoring. We all have our preferences as to how code should be written, but unnecessary
  refactoring can waste time and introduce new bugs. If you believe that refactoring is needed, you
  first must explain how it helps in concrete terms. Does it improve the performance?
- Applications of new language features for their own sake. Using advanced C++ language constructs
  is actually a negative as it may reduce portability (to old compilers, old standard libraries and
  systems) and reduce accessibility (to programmers that have not kept up), so it must be offsetted
  by clear gains like performance or maintainability. When in doubt, avoid advanced C++ features
  (beyond C++11).
- Style formatting. In general, please abstain from reformatting code just to make it look prettier.
  Though code formatting is important, it can also be a waste of time if several contributors try to
  tweak the code base toward their own preference. Please do not introduce unneeded white-space
  changes.

In short, most code changes should either bring new features or better performance. We want to avoid unmotivated code changes.


Specific rules
----------

We have few hard rules, but we have some:

- Printing to standard output or standard error (`stderr`, `stdout`, `std::cerr`, `std::cout`) in the core library is forbidden. This follows from the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual which states that "Compiled code should not write to stdout or stderr".
- Calls to `abort()` are forbidden in the core library. This follows from the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual which states that "Under no circumstances should your compiled code ever call abort or exit".
- All source code files (.h, .cpp) must be ASCII.
- All C macros introduced in public headers need to be prefixed with either `SIMDJSON_` or `simdjson_`.
- We avoid trailing white space characters within lines. That is, your lines of code should not terminate with unnecessary spaces. Generally, please avoid making unnecessary changes to white-space characters when contributing code.

Tools, tests and benchmarks are not held to these same strict rules.

General Guidelines
----------

Contributors are encouraged to :

- Document their changes. Though we do not enforce a rule regarding code comments, we prefer that non-trivial algorithms and techniques be somewhat documented in the code.
- Follow as much as possible the existing code style. We do not enforce a specific code style, but we prefer consistency.
- Modify as few lines of code as possible when working on an issue. The more lines you modify, the harder it is for your fellow human beings to understand what is going on.
- Tools may report "problems" with the code, but we never delegate programming to tools: if there is a problem with the code, we need to understand it. Thus we will not "fix" code merely to please a static analyzer if we do not understand.
- Provide tests for any new feature. We will not merge a new feature without tests.

Pull Requests
--------------

Pull requests are always invited. However, we ask that you follow these guidelines:

- It is wiser to discuss your ideas first as part of an issue before you start coding. If you omit this step and code first, be prepare to have your code receive scrutiny and be dropped.
- Users should provide a rationale for their changes. Does it improve performance? Does it add a feature? Does it improve maintainability? Does fix a bug? This must be explicitly stated as part of the pull request. Do not propose changes based on taste or intuition. We do not delegate programming to tools: that some tool suggested a code change is not reason enough to change the code.
   1. When your code improves performance, please document the gains with a benchmark using hard numbers.
   2. If your code fixes a bug, please be either fix a failing test, or propose a new test.
   3. Other types of changes must be clearly motivated. We openly discourage changes with no identifiable benefits.
- Changes should be focused and minimal. You should change as few lines of code as possible. Please do not reformat or touch files needlessly.
- New features must be accompanied of new tests, in general.
- Your code should pass our continuous-integration tests. It is your responsibility to ensure that your proposal pass the tests. We do not merge pull requests that would break our build.
   - An exception to this would be changes to non-code files, such as documentation and assets, or trivial changes to code, such as comments, where it is encouraged to explicitly ask for skipping a CI run using the `[skip ci]` prefix in your Pull Request title **and** in the first line of the most recent commit in a push. Example for such a commit: `[skip ci] Fixed typo in power_of_ten's docs`
   This benefits the project in such a way that the CI pipeline is not burdened by running jobs on changes that don't change any behavior in the code, which reduces wait times for other Pull Requests that do change behavior and require testing.

If the benefits of your proposed code remain unclear, we may choose to discard your code: that is not an insult, we frequently discard our own code. We may also consider various alternatives and choose another path. Again, that is not an insult or a sign that you have wasted your time.

Style
-----

Our formatting style is inspired by the LLVM style.
The simdjson library is written using the snake case: when a variable or a function is a phrase,  each space is replaced by an underscore character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.  Compile-time constants are written entirely in uppercase with the same underscore convention.

Code of Conduct
---------------

Though we do not have a formal code of conduct, we will not tolerate bullying, bigotry or
intimidation. Everyone is welcome to contribute. If you have concerns, you can raise them privately with the core team members (e.g., D. Lemire, J. Keiser).

We welcome contributions from women and less represented groups. If you need help, please reach out.

Consider the following points when engaging with the project:

- We discourage arguments from authority: ideas are discusssed on their own merits and not based on who stated it.
- Be mindful that what you may view as an aggression is maybe merely a difference of opinion or a misunderstanding.
- Be mindful that a collection of small aggressions, even if mild in isolation, can become harmful.

Getting Started Hacking

2025-07-08 06:03:29.616 | INFO     | C++ Standard Version:
- C++11 (`cxx_std_11`)

Required CMake Version:
- 3.14

Overview of Build Steps:
- The project builds the `simdjson` library from `src/simdjson.cpp`.
- Various build options are available, including:
    - `SIMDJSON_ENABLE_THREADS`: Links with thread support (default ON).
    - `SIMDJSON_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_API`: Disables deprecated APIs (default OFF).
    - `SIMDJSON_DEVELOPMENT_CHECKS`: Enables development-time aids (default OFF, ON in DEBUG).
    - `SIMDJSON_DEVELOPER_MODE`: Enables targets for developing simdjson (default OFF, ON if `CI` environment variable is set).
    - `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: Builds simdjson as a shared library (default OFF).
- The build process includes several subdirectories: `windows`, `dependencies`, `tools`, `jsonexamples`, `singleheader`, `tests`, `examples`, `benchmark`, and `fuzz`.
- Installation rules are defined for the library, headers, and CMake package configuration files.
- CPack is configured for creating source packages (TGZ, ZIP) and RPMs.

How Tests are Added and Enabled:
- Testing is enabled by `enable_testing()`.
- A custom target `all_tests` is created to build all tests.
- The `tests` subdirectory is added (`add_subdirectory(tests)`), implying that actual test executables and their definitions are located within this directory's `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Several `add_test` calls are defined directly in the main `CMakeLists.txt` for static analysis checks to ensure the library doesn't use `abort`, `cout`, `cerr`, `printf`, `stdout`, or `stderr` (when not in `SIMDJSON_SANITIZE` mode). These tests verify the library's characteristics.
- Running `ctest` would execute the defined tests.

2025-07-08 06:03:40.684 | INFO     | Tests are defined, built, and executed within the CMake system as follows:

**Test Definition:**
*   Tests are primarily defined using the `add_cpp_test` CMake function, which is included from `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/add_cpp_test.cmake`. This function is responsible for creating executable test targets and registering them with CTest.
*   The `CMakeLists.txt` file includes tests directly (e.g., `unicode_tests`, `minify_tests`, `padded_string_tests`, `checkimplementation`).
*   Additional tests are organized into subdirectories (`dom`, `ondemand`, `compilation_failure_tests`), each containing their own `CMakeLists.txt` file that presumably defines further tests using `add_cpp_test` or similar mechanisms.
*   Tests are linked against `simdjson-internal-flags`, `test-data`, `simdjson-windows-headers` (for most tests), and `simdjson` (for tests after the second `link_libraries` call).

**Build Process:**
*   The `cmake` command is used to configure the project and generate build files (e.g., Makefiles, Ninja build files, Visual Studio projects).
*   The build system (e.g., `make`, `ninja`, Visual Studio) is then used to compile the source code and create the test executables.
*   A `add_custom_command` is used for conditional post-build steps (e.g., copying the `simdjson` DLL into the test directory on MSVC when building shared libraries).

**Test Execution:**
*   After the project is built, tests are executed using the `ctest` utility, which is part of CMake.
*   The `add_cpp_test` function automatically registers the created test executables with CTest.

**How to run a single test like `ondemand_readme_examples.cpp`:**

1.  **Configure and Build the Project:**
    First, navigate to your project's root directory, create a build directory, and run CMake to configure and build the project:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . # or 'make' if using Makefiles, or build through your IDE
    ```
2.  **Run the Specific Test with CTest:**
    From your build directory, you can run a specific test using `ctest` with the `-R` (regular expression) option to match the test's name. The exact test name is typically derived from the `add_cpp_test` call in `tests/ondemand/CMakeLists.txt`. Assuming the test executable name is `ondemand_readme_examples`:
    ```bash
    ctest -R "ondemand_readme_examples"
    ```
    If you're unsure of the exact test name, you can list all available tests first:
    ```bash
    ctest --show-only=json-v1 # For detailed info
    # or
    ctest -N # For just test names
    ```
    Then use the exact name found with `ctest -R "ExactTestName"`.
