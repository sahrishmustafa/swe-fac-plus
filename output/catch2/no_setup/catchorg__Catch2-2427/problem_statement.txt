Unused variable warnings when compiling with nvcc + gcc
When compiling CUDA files with nvcc (CUDA 11.3 and GCC 9.4), when including catch2 and declaring a simple test case, I'm getting warnings such as `variable "[...]autoRegistrar1" was declared but never referenced`.
Is there a way to get rid of these warnings?
