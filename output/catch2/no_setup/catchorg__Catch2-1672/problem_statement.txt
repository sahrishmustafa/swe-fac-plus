The first vector returned by ChunkGenerator is size 1 when chunk-size is 0
**Describe the bug**
When using `ChunkGenerator` with a chunk-size of 0, the first vector returned is size 1. Following vectors are size 0.

**Expected behavior**
The first (and all following) vectors should be size 0.

**Reproduction steps**
```c++
TEST_CASE("chunks") {
  auto vector = GENERATE(take(5, chunk(0, value(1))));
  REQUIRE(vector.size() == 0);
}
```


**Platform information:**
<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->
 - OS: **Linux 5.1.15-arch1-1-ARCH**
 - Compiler+version: **g++ (GCC) 9.1.0**
 - Catch version: **Catch v2.7.2** ([it looks like the bug still exists though](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/54089c4c8c657ffb13d8f3a1425403335af5ba4d/include/internal/catch_generators_generic.hpp#L208-L209))


**Additional context**
My specific use-case in which I ran into this is a test like this:

```c++
TEST_CASE("my function") {
  auto size = GENERATE(0, 1, 2, 3);
  auto vector = GENERATE_COPY(take(1, chunk(size, random(-100, 100))));

  auto list = VectorToList(vector);
  
  REQUIRE(list.size() == size);
}
```

It's possible that the intended behaviour was to return a minimum chunk-size of 1 for all chunks, but I think it would make much more sense to return empty vectors, otherwise the use-case above would be more annoying to write.
