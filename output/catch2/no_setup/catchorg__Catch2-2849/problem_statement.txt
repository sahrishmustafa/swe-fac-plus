Handle ANSI escape sequences during text wrapping
**Description**

I'd like to provide diagnostic messages from a `Catch::Matchers::MatcherBase::describe` function that are colored with ANSI sequences, however Catch2's line wrapping interferes with this.

Would a PR to update the line wrapping logic be welcomed?

**Additional context**

I have an assertion library that I'd like to provide a catch2 integration for. Without color codes, with my current attempt to make it work in Catch2, it looks like this:

However with color codes the lines are messed up and escape sequences are split in the middle:
