Make CHECKED_IF and CHECKED_ELSE "ok to fail"
## Description
Both `CHECKED_IF` and `CHECKED_ELSE` are currently fairly obscure macros that simplify using `if`/`else` in tests.

However, entering the `else` branch fails the test in which it occurs, because they are not marked as being ok to fail (tagged with `Catch::ResultDisposition::SuppressFail` to be exact). This behaviour makes them less than useful, but with a change they should be actually usable.

Milestone 3.0, because it is a theoretically breaking change.
