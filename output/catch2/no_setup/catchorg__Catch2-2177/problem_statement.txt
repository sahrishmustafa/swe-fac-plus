Add surrogate TUs for header files
## Description

This PR adds surrogate TUs to test that each header file in the project can be included without depending on other files.

In order for the PR to be complete I have to clean the commit history.
Also 5 files are commented in the CMakeLists.txt of SurrogateCpps since they need to be fixed.

## GitHub Issues

Closes #2106
