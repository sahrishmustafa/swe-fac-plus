This indicates that passing the file path directly to the Catch2 test executable as a filter is not the correct approach, as Catch2 filters are based on test case names (defined using the `TEST_CASE` macro) or tags. Once the content of the target test file is retrieved, the eval script should be updated to use the appropriate test case name or a specific tag from `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/MatchersRanges.tests.cpp` as an argument to the `./tests/SelfTest` executable to correctly filter and run the target test cases.",

This is necessary to identify the exact test case names or tags defined within the file, which are required to construct the correct filter argument for the Catch2 test runner (`./tests/SelfTest`).",
