This filter applies to test case names, but the tests in `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/MatchersRanges.tests.cpp` are not named with this pattern. Instead, Catch2 tests often use tags for categorization.\n\nLooking at the typical structure of Catch2's self-tests, the test cases within `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/MatchersRanges.tests.cpp` are likely tagged with `[ranges]` or similar tags related to range matchers. \n\n**Action:** Modify the eval script to use a Catch2 tag filter instead of a name wildcard. Change the test execution line:\n\nOLD: `./tests/SelfTest \"*MatchersRanges*\"`\nNEW: `./tests/SelfTest \"[ranges]\"`\n\nThis filter is more likely to correctly identify and run the target tests.",
