This means the Catch2 test runner was executed successfully, but it did not find any tests matching the specified filter. The filter `[ranges]` is likely incorrect or too broad for the target test file `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/MatchersRanges.tests.cpp`. To correctly execute the tests within this file, you will need to determine the precise test case name(s) or tags defined inside `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/MatchersRanges.tests.cpp`. Once this information is available, revise the test execution command to use an exact test case name or a more specific tag/filter that guarantees finding the tests from this file.",

This is necessary to identify the actual test case names and tags defined within the file, which will allow the `write_eval_script_agent` to construct the correct test execution command.",
