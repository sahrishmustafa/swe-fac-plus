## Catch2 v3 is being developed!

You are on the `devel` branch, where the next major version, v3, of
Catch2 is being developed. As it is a significant rework, you will
find that parts of this documentation are likely still stuck on v2.

For stable (and documentation-matching) version of Catch2, [go to the
`v2.x` branch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x).

For migrating from the v2 releases to v3, you should look at [our
documentation](docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top). It provides a simple
guidelines on getting started, and collects most common migration
problems.


## What's the Catch2?

Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also
provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural.
Tests autoregister themselves and do not have to be named with valid
identifiers, assertions look like normal C++ code, and sections provide
a nice way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.


## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md#top)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#top) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md#top) - all the details


## More
* Issues and bugs can be raised on the [Issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues)
* For discussion or questions please use [the dedicated Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/catch-forum) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD)
* See [who else is using Catch2](docs/opensource-users.md#top)

- Build System: CMake (minimum version 3.5)
- Project Name & Version: Catch2, Version 3.0.0
- Languages: CXX (C++)

Key CMake Options (default values are specified if present):
- CATCH_INSTALL_DOCS: ON
- CATCH_INSTALL_EXTRAS: ON
- CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD: OFF (This option significantly alters build behavior, e.g., enabling/disabling Werror, building tests, etc.)
- CATCH_BUILD_TESTING: ON (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_BUILD_EXAMPLES: OFF (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS: OFF (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_BUILD_FUZZERS: OFF (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_ENABLE_COVERAGE: OFF (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_ENABLE_WERROR: ON (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD - set to ON if CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD is OFF)
- CATCH_BUILD_SURROGATES: OFF (conditional on CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- CATCH_TEST_USE_WMAIN: Not defaulted in this file (affects linker flags for Windows wmain entry point).

Runtime Requirements:
- C++ runtime environment.
- Python 3: Required for building tests (if enabled).

Custom Query Response:
- C++ Standard: Not explicitly specified within this `CMakeLists.txt` file. The C++ compiler's default standard will be used unless set in a subdirectory or by overriding `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`.
- Compiler Flags:
    - `-Werror` is enabled by default via the `CATCH_ENABLE_WERROR` option (which is ON when `CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` is OFF).
    - If `CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` is ON, additional warnings are added via `add_warnings_to_targets`, though the specific flags are not defined in this file.
    - Linker Flag (Windows specific): `/ENTRY:wmainCRTStartup` is added to `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` if `CATCH_TEST_USE_WMAIN` is ON.
- Test Target Definitions:
    - Main tests (e.g., SelfTest) are defined in the `tests/` subdirectory.
    - Extra tests are defined in the `tests/ExtraTests/` subdirectory (built if `CATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS` is ON).
    - Fuzzers are defined in the `fuzzing/` subdirectory (built if `CATCH_BUILD_FUZZERS` is ON).
    - Building of tests generally depends on the CMake standard variable `BUILD_TESTING` set to ON, `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` set to ON, and `NOT_SUBPROJECT` being ON.

Testing:
- Test Framework: Catch2 (SelfTest).
- Test Prerequisites: Python 3 if tests are built.
- Test Commands/Workflow:
    1.  Create a build directory outside the source tree: `mkdir build && cd build`.
    2.  Configure the project: `cmake ..` (by default, `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` is ON). To enable more development features including CTest integration: `cmake -DCATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD=ON ..`.
    3.  Build the project: `cmake --build .`.
    4.  Run tests: If `CATCH_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` is ON, `CTest` is enabled, and tests can be run via `ctest`. Otherwise, individual test executables compiled in the build directory would need to be run manually (e.g., `tests/SelfTest`).

The `-R` flag in `ctest` filters by this top-level CTest-registered test name (the executable name), not by the source file path or individual test cases within it.\n\nTo resolve this: \n1.  **Update the `ctest -R` regex:** Change the line `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"SelfTest\\\\.UsageTests\\\\.Compilation\"` in the eval script to target the correct CTest test name.

This can be done using CTest's `--test-args` option. For example, if the tests in `Compilation.tests.cpp` have a specific tag (e.g., `[compilation]`), you could use: `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\" --test-args \"[compilation]\"`.

    "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The test execution failed because CTest reported \"No tests were found!!!\" (line 81). This indicates that the `ctest -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\"` command did not correctly identify and run the tests. While the `SelfTest` executable was successfully built (line 74), the CTest regular expression based on the executable name `Catch2_SelfTest` did not cause tests to run. \n\nTo resolve this, modify the evaluation script to directly execute the `SelfTest` executable built by CMake. This executable typically includes all `TEST_CASE`s defined within the Catch2 self-tests and running it directly will execute them.\n\n**Specific changes needed for `write_eval_script_agent`:**\n1. Locate the line `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\"`.\n2. Replace this line with a direct execution of the compiled `SelfTest` binary. Based on the build log, the executable resides at `/testbed/Build/tests/SelfTest`.\n\n**Revised command:**\n```bash\n./tests/SelfTest\nrc=$? # Ensure the exit code from the SelfTest executable is captured\n```\nThis change will ensure that the Catch2 tests within the `SelfTest` suite are properly invoked.",
