This happens because the `tests/SelfTest/UsageTests/Compilation.tests.cpp` file was modified by the patch, but the corresponding test executable(s) were not recompiled afterwards. Consequently, the changes introduced by the patch were not incorporated into the runnable binaries.\n\nTo fix this, please modify the evaluation script as follows:\n\n1.  **Add a recompilation step** after the test patch has been applied and after navigating into the `/testbed/Build` directory. This will ensure that the updated source files are compiled into the test executables.\n\nProposed change for the eval script:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the 'Build' directory, where the CMake-generated executables and tests reside.\n# The Dockerfile has already performed the build steps, including creating and populating 'Build'.\necho \"Navigating to /testbed/Build directory for test execution...\"\ncd /testbed/Build || { echo \"Error: 'Build' directory not found at /testbed/Build. Ensure build steps completed in Dockerfile.\"; exit 1; }\n\n# IMPORTANT: Recompile the project after applying the patch to incorporate changes\necho \"Recompiling project after patch application...\"\nmake -j $(nproc) || { echo \"Error: Failed to recompile project. Aborting.\"; exit 1; }\n\n# Execute the specific Catch2 self-test executable which contains the target test file's logic.\n# The previous CTest regex was incorrect and did not match the actual CTest registered test names.\n# Based on Catch2's build system, the self-test suite (which includes tests from Compilation.tests.cpp)\n# is registered under the CTest name \"Catch2_SelfTest\".\necho \"Running tests matching CTest executable name 'Catch2_SelfTest'...\nCTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\"\nrc=$? # Capture the exit code of the ctest command immediately\n```\n\nThis modification will ensure that any test cases added or modified by the patch are correctly compiled and made available for CTest to discover and execute.",
