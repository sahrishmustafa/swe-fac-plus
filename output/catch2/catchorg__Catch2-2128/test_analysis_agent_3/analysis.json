  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The test execution failed because CTest reported \"No tests were found!!!\" (line 81). This indicates that the `ctest -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\"` command did not correctly identify and run the tests. While the `SelfTest` executable was successfully built (line 74), the CTest regular expression based on the executable name `Catch2_SelfTest` did not cause tests to run. \n\nTo resolve this, modify the evaluation script to directly execute the `SelfTest` executable built by CMake. This executable typically includes all `TEST_CASE`s defined within the Catch2 self-tests and running it directly will execute them.\n\n**Specific changes needed for `write_eval_script_agent`:**\n1. Locate the line `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"Catch2_SelfTest\"`.\n2. Replace this line with a direct execution of the compiled `SelfTest` binary. Based on the build log, the executable resides at `/testbed/Build/tests/SelfTest`.\n\n**Revised command:**\n```bash\n./tests/SelfTest\nrc=$? # Ensure the exit code from the SelfTest executable is captured\n```\nThis change will ensure that the Catch2 tests within the `SelfTest` suite are properly invoked.",
