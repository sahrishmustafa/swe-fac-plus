  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The evaluation script successfully executed the CMake configuration, Ninja build, and CTest commands. All tests defined by the target CMakeLists.txt files were built and executed. However, one test, 'ApprovalTests' (Test #28), failed with the message 'Error regular expression found in output. Regex=[Results differed]'. The detailed log indicates that the outputs from the 'compact' reporter for this test did not match their approved baselines (e.g., 'compact.sw.approved.txt' vs. 'compact.sw.unapproved.txt'). This typically happens when the test's expected output (baseline) is outdated compared to the actual output produced by the current code, possibly due to changes introduced by the applied patch or subtle differences in Catch2's reporting format in version 3.1. The test execution itself was correct; the failure is a logical one where the generated output does not match the stored reference. No changes to the eval script's commands or flow are necessary to 'run' the tests, as they already did successfully. The core issue is the logical failure of the specific test due to content mismatch, which would usually require regenerating/approving new baselines with `approve.py` if the changes are intended, or a revision of the test patch if the changes are unintended. As such, no actionable guidance can be provided to fix the eval script's *execution* unless the intent is to skip this specific failing approval test, which is not the standard procedure for verifying test execution.",
