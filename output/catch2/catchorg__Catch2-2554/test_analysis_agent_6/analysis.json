  "guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent": "The test execution pipeline (Dockerfile and eval script) successfully compiled the project and ran all specified Catch2 test executables. The environment setup was correct, and the evaluation script correctly identified and invoked the tests, and captured their exit codes (OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=1 indicating overall failure). However, several test executables within 'tests/ExtraTests/' reported failures or internal errors (e.g., 'DisabledExceptions-CustomHandler' shows 'FAILED: CHECK( 1 == 2 )', 'DuplicatedReporters' shows 'Errors occurred during startup! reporter using 'test-reporter' as name was already registered', and 'DuplicatedTestCases-DuplicatedTestCaseMethods' shows 'error: test case ... already defined.'). These specific failures appear to stem from the logic of the Catch2 internal tests themselves, which might be designed to test error handling or specific edge cases by intentionally failing, rather than indicating an issue with the environment or the test execution script. To ascertain if these are expected failures for Catch2's internal test suite or if further intervention (e.g., specific build flags, test filtering) is required, please investigate the 'catchorg/Catch2' repository's documentation, build system configurations (e.g., CMake options used in CI/test pipelines), or existing test-related issues for commit '8ce92d2c7288b6b3261caf1c016f8a779b6a8efc'. Focus on the expected behavior of tests like 'DisabledExceptions-DefaultHandler.cpp', 'X33-DuplicatedTestCaseMethods.cpp', and 'X01-PrefixedMacros.cpp'.",
