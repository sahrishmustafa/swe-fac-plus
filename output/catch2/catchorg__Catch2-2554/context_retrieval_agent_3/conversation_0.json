To achieve this, you can use the following APIs to browse and extract relevant information:\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\nYou may invoke multiple APIs in one round as needed to gather the required information.\n\nNow analyze the repository and use the necessary APIs to gather the information required to understand and set up the environment.

        "content": "After setting up dockerfile and running tests, the test log analysis agent find that there is other context information need to collect. Here is his analysis:\nThe test execution pipeline (Dockerfile and eval script) successfully compiled the project and ran all specified Catch2 test executables. The environment setup was correct, and the evaluation script correctly identified and invoked the tests, and captured their exit codes (OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=1 indicating overall failure). However, several test executables within 'tests/ExtraTests/' reported failures or internal errors (e.g., 'DisabledExceptions-CustomHandler' shows 'FAILED: CHECK( 1 == 2 )', 'DuplicatedReporters' shows 'Errors occurred during startup! reporter using 'test-reporter' as name was already registered', and 'DuplicatedTestCases-DuplicatedTestCaseMethods' shows 'error: test case ... already defined.'). These specific failures appear to stem from the logic of the Catch2 internal tests themselves, which might be designed to test error handling or specific edge cases by intentionally failing, rather than indicating an issue with the environment or the test execution script. To ascertain if these are expected failures for Catch2's internal test suite or if further intervention (e.g., specific build flags, test filtering) is required, please investigate the 'catchorg/Catch2' repository's documentation, build system configurations (e.g., CMake options used in CI/test pipelines), or existing test-related issues for commit '8ce92d2c7288b6b3261caf1c016f8a779b6a8efc'. Focus on the expected behavior of tests like 'DisabledExceptions-DefaultHandler.cpp', 'X33-DuplicatedTestCaseMethods.cpp', and 'X01-PrefixedMacros.cpp'.\n\n"
