Regex=[Results differed]' (lines 360, 401, 452). The log indicates that the output of certain reporters (e.g., 'compact.sw' and 'compact.sw.multi') differed from their approved baselines, and it suggests running 'approve.py' to approve new baselines (line 470).\n\nThis is not an issue with the Dockerfile (the environment is set up correctly, and compilation succeeded) nor a problem with the evaluation script's commands (it correctly invoked CMake, Ninja, and CTest).\n\nThe failure indicates a discrepancy in the expected test output for the 'ApprovalTests'. To resolve this, more context about the project's testing methodology is required:\n1. Investigate the `approve.py` script located within the Catch2 repository. Determine its purpose, how it's invoked, and if it's meant to be run as part of a standard test execution cycle to update baselines.\n2. Ascertain if these output differences (especially concerning the 'compact' reporter's summary statistics, as seen in the diff at lines 395-397 and 446-448) are expected when running Catch2 3.1 tests on Ubuntu 20.04 with GCC 9.4.0, or if they point to an actual issue in test output generation.\n3. Identify if there are any specific environment variables or CMake configurations relevant to test output stability across different environments that might need to be set.",
