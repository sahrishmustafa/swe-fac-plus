To achieve this, you can use the following APIs to browse and extract relevant information:\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\nYou may invoke multiple APIs in one round as needed to gather the required information.\n\nNow analyze the repository and use the necessary APIs to gather the information required to understand and set up the environment.

Here is his analysis:\nThe target tests did not fully pass. Specifically, 'Test #28: ApprovalTests' failed with the message 'Error regular expression found in output. Regex=[Results differed]' (lines 360, 401, 452). The log indicates that the output of certain reporters (e.g., 'compact.sw' and 'compact.sw.multi') differed from their approved baselines, and it suggests running 'approve.py' to approve new baselines (line 470).\n\nThis is not an issue with the Dockerfile (the environment is set up correctly, and compilation succeeded) nor a problem with the evaluation script's commands (it correctly invoked CMake, Ninja, and CTest).\n\nThe failure indicates a discrepancy in the expected test output for the 'ApprovalTests'. To resolve this, more context about the project's testing methodology is required:\n1. Investigate the `approve.py` script located within the Catch2 repository. Determine its purpose, how it's invoked, and if it's meant to be run as part of a standard test execution cycle to update baselines.\n2. Ascertain if these output differences (especially concerning the 'compact' reporter's summary statistics, as seen in the diff at lines 395-397 and 446-448) are expected when running Catch2 3.1 tests on Ubuntu 20.04 with GCC 9.4.0, or if they point to an actual issue in test output generation.\n3. Identify if there are any specific environment variables or CMake configurations relevant to test output stability across different environments that might need to be set.\n\n"
