This is causing all test runs to fail with the error \"Unrecognised token: --exclude-tag\".\n\nTo fix this:\n1. Remove the `--exclude-tag \"[.ApprovalTests]\"` argument from both `\"$test_binary\" --exclude-tag \"[.ApprovalTests]\"` commands in the `eval_script`.\n2. The `python3 tools/scripts/approve.py` step is already present to handle ApprovalTests baselines. By removing the exclusion, we will allow all tests to run to see their actual pass/fail status, and `approve.py` should reconcile any approval test issues. If ApprovalTests still cause failures after this change, and are indeed meant to be excluded, the correct Catch2 v3 syntax for excluding tags (e.g., `~[ApprovalTests]`) should be investigated and applied.",
