Compact reporter does not handle [!shouldfail] properly
## Description
Compact reporter does not handle the `[!shouldfail]` tag properly. Given this code (from #876):
```cpp
bool thisThrows() {
    throw std::runtime_error("Boom");
}

TEST_CASE("#748 - captures with unexpected exceptions", "[!shouldfail]") {
    int answer = 42;
    CAPTURE(answer);
    // the message should be printed on the first two sections but not on the third
    SECTION("outside assertions") {
        thisThrows();
    }
    SECTION("inside REQUIRE_NOTHROW") {
        REQUIRE_NOTHROW(thisThrows());
    }
    SECTION("inside REQUIRE_THROWS") {
        REQUIRE_THROWS(thisThrows());
    }
}
```
compact reporter's output is
```
<snip>
Passed all 0 test cases with 1 assertion.
```
which, while kind-of correct, is surprising. Standard console reporter's output looks like this:
```
<snip>
test cases: 1 | 1 failed as expected
assertions: 3 | 1 passed | 2 failed as expected
```
which is much clearer about what happened and should be in some way replicated by the compact reporter.
