  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed due to C++ compilation errors related to `constexpr` and `sysconf` in `catch_fatal_condition.cpp`. This typically indicates an incompatibility between the Catch2 v2.3 source code and the C++ compiler version (g++ 11.4.0 on Ubuntu 22.04) or stricter rules enforced by newer compilers regarding `constexpr` and runtime values. To resolve this, change the base image to an older Ubuntu version that ships with an older, potentially more compatible GCC compiler. For example, use `ubuntu:20.04` instead of `ubuntu:22.04` as `ubuntu:20.04` typically uses GCC 9, which might be compatible with the Catch2 2.3 codebase.",
