This indicates that the compiler (GCC 9.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04) is treating a warning as an error. This is a common issue when building older C++ projects with newer, stricter compilers. To resolve this, change the base image from `ubuntu:20.04` to `ubuntu:18.04`. Ubuntu 18.04 typically ships with GCC 7.5.0, which is likely to be more compatible with Catch2 v2.3 and less prone to issue this specific warning as an error.",
