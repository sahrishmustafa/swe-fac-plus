<a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v2.3.0/catch.hpp">The latest version of the single header can be downloaded directly using this link</a>

## Catch2 is released!

If you've been using an earlier version of Catch, please see the
Breaking Changes section of [the release notes](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
before moving to Catch2. You might also like to read [this blog post](http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2017/11/3/catch2-released.html) for more details.

## What's the Catch?

Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a
multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports Objective-C
(and maybe C).
It is primarily distributed as a single header file, although certain
extensions may require additional headers.

## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md#top)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#top) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md#top) - all the details

## More
* Issues and bugs can be raised on the [Issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues)
* For discussion or questions please use [the dedicated Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/catch-forum) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD)
* See [who else is using Catch2](docs/opensource-users.md#top)

- The `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` option controls whether the SelfTest project is built.
- The `CATCH_USE_VALGRIND` option allows running SelfTests with Valgrind.
- To run tests, the standard `ctest` command would likely be used after building.

Key environment variables:
- CXXFLAGS (set to `additional_flags` before build)

Runtime Requirements:
- Python (for `codecov` installation)
- Visual Studio (2015, 2017) on AppVeyor for Windows builds

Testing:

Common build tools/steps applicable to Linux (derived from Windows configuration):

*   **Compiler/Language**: The project is undeniably C++, supporting C++17 (`/std:c++latest`). On Linux, this would translate directly to using `g++` or `clang++` with `--std=c++17` or `--std=c++2a` (or `c++latest`). Preprocessor definitions like `_UNICODE` would be passed with `-D_UNICODE`.
*   **Build System**: `CMake` is explicitly mentioned as the build system ("Cmake will autodetect the compiler"). This is a cross-platform build system and is the standard choice for C++ projects on Linux. You would typically run `cmake <source_dir>` followed by `make` (or `ninja` if configured) on Linux to build the project.
*   **Build Flags**: Flags such as `additional_flags` are passed to CXXFLAGS. While `/permissive-` is MSVC-specific, the concept of passing compiler flags (e.g., for strictness, warnings, or standard versions) is common across all compilers on Linux.
*   **Testing Framework**: `CTEST` is used for running tests. CTest is fully cross-platform and is the standard test runner for CMake-based projects. On Linux, you would run `ctest` from the build directory to execute tests. Setting `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` is directly applicable.
*   **Coverage Tools**: `codecov` (Python library for uploading coverage reports) is cross-platform. While `OpenCppCoverage` is Windows-specific, on Linux, equivalent tools like `gcov` (for GCC) or `llvm-cov` (for Clang), combined with `lcov` for report generation, would typically be used.

- Python 2.7 (for `ApprovalTests` if `CATCH_DIR` is set and script path is valid)
- Valgrind (optional, if `CATCH_USE_VALGRIND` is enabled)

Testing:
- **Test Framework**: Catch2 (inferred by file names like `catch.hpp`, `SelfTest` executable, and test commands)
- **Test Executable**: `SelfTest` (created by `add_executable`). It compiles:
    - Many `.tests.cpp` files (e.g., `CmdLine.tests.cpp`, `Approx.tests.cpp`) from `${SELF_TEST_DIR}`.
    - Surrogate C++ source files (e.g., `catch_console_colour.cpp`).
    - Internal Catch2 implementation files (e.g., `catch_approx.cpp`).
    - Catch2 reporter implementation files (e.g., `catch_reporter_console.cpp`).
- **Test Runner**: CTest (explicitly included via `include(CTest)`).
- **Test Commands**:
    - `RunTests`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest>` (runs all tests).
    - `ListTests`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-tests --verbosity high` (lists tests with high verbosity).
    - `ListTags`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-tags` (lists test tags).
    - `ListReporters`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-reporters` (lists available reporters).
    - `ListTestNamesOnly`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-test-names-only` (lists only test names).
    - `NoAssertions`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> -w NoAssertions` (runs a specific test case, checking for no assertions).
    - `NoTest`: `$<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> -w NoTests "___nonexistent_test___"` (runs a non-existent test, checking for no matches).
    - `ApprovalTests`: `python ${CATCH_DIR}/scripts/approvalTests.py $<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest>` (runs Python approval tests, depends on `CATCH_DIR`).
    - `ValgrindRunTests` (conditional, if `CATCH_USE_VALGRIND` is true): `valgrind --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1 $<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest>`
    - `ValgrindListTests` (conditional, if `CATCH_USE_VALGRIND` is true): `valgrind --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1 $<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-tests --verbosity high`
    - `ValgrindListTags` (conditional, if `CATCH_USE_VALGRIND` is true): `valgrind --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1 $<TARGET_FILE:SelfTest> --list-tags`
- **Compiler Flags**:
    - Common: `-Wall -Wextra -Wunreachable-code -Wpedantic -Wmissing-declarations`
    - Clang specific: `-Wweak-vtables -Wexit-time-destructors -Wglobal-constructors -Wmissing-noreturn`
    - MSVC specific: `/W4`, `/w44265 /w44061 /w44062`, `/utf-8`
    - Warnings as errors: `-Werror` (Clang/GNUMake) or `/WX` (MSVC) if `CATCH_ENABLE_WERROR` is true.
- **Coverage**: Supports code coverage if `CATCH_ENABLE_COVERAGE` is true, using `find_package(codecov)` and `add_coverage(SelfTest)`.

Environment Setup:**\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).\n*   **Required Dependencies:**\n    *   C++ Compiler: `g++` (GCC) or `clang++`. A recent version is sufficient.\n    *   Build System: `CMake` (minimum 3.5).\n    *   Build Tool: `make`.\n*   These dependencies are typically available via a standard package manager like `apt` (e.g., `build-essential` for g++ and make, `cmake`).\n*   Python is present in the repository, but not strictly required for building and running the C++ tests themselves.\n\n**2. Build Process:**\n*   **Build System:** CMake.\n*   **Build Directory:** Out-of-source build is standard practice (e.g., `mkdir build && cd build`).\n*   **CMake Configuration Command:**\n    *   `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON ..`\n    *   `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` ensures the `SelfTest` executable is built, which contains all test cases.\n*   **Compilation Command:**\n    *   `make -j $(nproc)` (from within the build directory).\n\n**3. Test Execution:**\n*   **Test Executable:** The build process creates a single test executable named `SelfTest` located at `build/projects/SelfTest`.\n*   **Test Framework:** Catch2's own command-line interface.\n*   **Target Test File:** `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/BDD.tests.cpp`.\n*   **Execution Command for Specific Test File:**\n    *   Since Catch2 compiles all tests into one executable, we use its filtering capabilities. Tests in `BDD.tests.cpp` are typically tagged with `[BDD]`.\n    *   From the build directory (`build`): `./projects/SelfTest \"[BDD]\" --success --verbosity high`\n    *   `--success` flag ensures the test executable exits with a non-zero code on test failure, which is crucial for automated testing.",

This indicates that the compiler (GCC 9.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04) is treating a warning as an error. This is a common issue when building older C++ projects with newer, stricter compilers. To resolve this, change the base image from `ubuntu:20.04` to `ubuntu:18.04`. Ubuntu 18.04 typically ships with GCC 7.5.0, which is likely to be more compatible with Catch2 v2.3 and less prone to issue this specific warning as an error.",
