Environment Setup:**\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).\n*   **Required Dependencies:**\n    *   C++ Compiler: `g++` (GCC) or `clang++`. A recent version is sufficient.\n    *   Build System: `CMake` (minimum 3.5).\n    *   Build Tool: `make`.\n*   These dependencies are typically available via a standard package manager like `apt` (e.g., `build-essential` for g++ and make, `cmake`).\n*   Python is present in the repository, but not strictly required for building and running the C++ tests themselves.\n\n**2. Build Process:**\n*   **Build System:** CMake.\n*   **Build Directory:** Out-of-source build is standard practice (e.g., `mkdir build && cd build`).\n*   **CMake Configuration Command:**\n    *   `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON ..`\n    *   `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` ensures the `SelfTest` executable is built, which contains all test cases.\n*   **Compilation Command:**\n    *   `make -j $(nproc)` (from within the build directory).\n\n**3. Test Execution:**\n*   **Test Executable:** The build process creates a single test executable named `SelfTest` located at `build/projects/SelfTest`.\n*   **Test Framework:** Catch2's own command-line interface.\n*   **Target Test File:** `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/BDD.tests.cpp`.\n*   **Execution Command for Specific Test File:**\n    *   Since Catch2 compiles all tests into one executable, we use its filtering capabilities. Tests in `BDD.tests.cpp` are typically tagged with `[BDD]`.\n    *   From the build directory (`build`): `./projects/SelfTest \"[BDD]\" --success --verbosity high`\n    *   `--success` flag ensures the test executable exits with a non-zero code on test failure, which is crucial for automated testing.\n\n"

        "content": "Generate an **evaluation script** based on the collected environment setup and test execution information.  \nThe script must execute the provided test files inside the specified Docker environment.\n\n### **Requirements:**\n1. **Activate the environment**: Ensure the correct environment (e.g., Conda, venv) is activated before running the tests.\n2. **Apply the test patch (if required)**: The test patch may need to be applied before running the tests.\n3. **Execute the given test files** using the correct command found by the context retrieval agent.\n4. **Ensure proper cleanup**: After running the tests, any modified files should be reset.\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
