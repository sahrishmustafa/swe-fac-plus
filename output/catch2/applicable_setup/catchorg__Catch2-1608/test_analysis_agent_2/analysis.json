The error 'call to non-'constexpr' function 'long int sysconf(int)' for MINSIGSTKSZ' indicates a compatibility issue with how `MINSIGSTKSZ` is defined and used in a `constexpr` context with the current compiler and C++14 standard. To resolve this, increase the C++ standard to C++17. Although `sysconf` is fundamentally not `constexpr`, using C++17 may resolve the issue due to compiler-specific optimizations or internal Catch2 compatibility with newer standards. Update the `cmake` command in the Dockerfile by changing `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14` to `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`.",
