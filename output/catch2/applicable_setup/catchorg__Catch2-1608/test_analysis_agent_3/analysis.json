  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step with compilation errors related to `catch_fatal_condition.cpp`, specifically \"error: call to non-'constexpr' function 'long int sysconf(int)'\" and \"error: size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression\". This issue commonly arises when compiling older C++ projects (like Catch2 2.7) with newer GCC versions (such as GCC 11, which is standard in Ubuntu 22.04) under stricter C++ standards like C++17. The `sysconf` function call is dynamic, while a constant expression is required for array sizing.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to provide an environment with a more compatible compiler version. Please change the base image from `ubuntu:22.04` to `ubuntu:20.04`. Ubuntu 20.04 typically includes GCC 9, which is more likely to compile Catch2 2.7 successfully with C++17 standard settings.",
