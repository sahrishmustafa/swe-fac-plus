The evaluation script correctly navigated, applied the test patch, executed the target tests (projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Message.tests.cpp), and captured the exit code. The log shows that 11 test cases passed and 8 test cases failed, resulting in a non-zero exit code (10). Since not all tests passed, the overall execution is not considered complete. The issue is not with the environment setup or test execution logic itself, but with the test failures. To diagnose why these tests failed, please provide the actual content of the 'test patch' that was applied to 'projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Message.tests.cpp'. This will help determine if the patch was intended to fix existing failures or if it introduced new ones, and guide further investigation into the failing tests or the code under test.",
