Runtime Requirements:
- Language: C++
- OS: Linux, macOS
- Linux Packages (apt):
    - clang-3.5, clang-3.6, clang-3.8, clang-3.9, clang-4.0, clang-5.0, clang-6.0
    - g++-4.8, g++-4.9, g++-5, g++-6, g++-7, g++-8

    - valgrind
- macOS Xcode images: xcode7.3, xcode8, xcode9, xcode9.1
- Python: 3.7 (for Conan build)

Build Matrix Overview:
The project uses a build matrix to test various configurations on Linux and macOS with different compilers (Clang, GCC) and C++ standards (C++11/default, C++14, C++17). Special builds for examples, coverage, and Valgrind are also included.

Installation Steps:
- Create `deps` directory: `mkdir -p ${DEPS_DIR} && cd ${DEPS_DIR}`
- Linux (CMake): Download and extract CMake 3.8.2:
  `CMAKE_URL="http://cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz"`
  `mkdir cmake && travis_retry wget --no-check-certificate --quiet -O - ${CMAKE_URL} | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C cmake`
  - Add to PATH: `export PATH=${DEPS_DIR}/cmake/bin:${PATH}`
- macOS (CMake): `which cmake || brew install cmake`
- Python (Conan): `pip install conan==1.10.2 conan-package-tools`

Build Commands:
- Set CXX compiler: `export CXX=${COMPILER}`
- Change directory to build root: `cd ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}`
- Generate single header file: `python scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`
- Configure Debug build:
  `cmake -H. -BBuild-Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -Wdev -DUSE_CPP14=${CPP14} -DUSE_CPP17=${CPP17} -DCATCH_USE_VALGRIND=${VALGRIND} -DCATCH_BUILD_EXAMPLES=${EXAMPLES} -DCATCH_ENABLE_COVERAGE=${COVERAGE} -DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=${EXTRAS}`
- Configure Release build:
  `cmake -H. -BBuild-Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Wdev -DUSE_CPP14=${CPP14} -DUSE_CPP17=${CPP17}`
- Compile Debug build: `cd Build-Debug && make -j 2`
- Compile Release build: `cd ../Build-Release && make -j 2`
- Conan build: `python .conan/build.py` (executed in a specific matrix entry)

Testing:
- Test framework: CTest
- Test commands:
    - Debug build tests: `cd Build-Debug && CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j 2`
    - Release build tests: `cd ../Build-Release && CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j 2`
- Coverage commands (Linux only, when COVERAGE=1):
    - `make gcov`
    - `make lcov`
    - `bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -X gcov`

<a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v2.7.2/catch.hpp">The latest version of the single header can be downloaded directly using this link</a>

## Catch2 is released!

If you've been using an earlier version of Catch, please see the
Breaking Changes section of [the release notes](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
before moving to Catch2. You might also like to read [this blog post](https://levelofindirection.com/blog/catch2-released.html) for more details.

## What's the Catch?

Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a
multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports Objective-C
(and maybe C).
It is primarily distributed as a single header file, although certain
extensions may require additional headers.

## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md#top)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#top) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md#top) - all the details

## More
* Issues and bugs can be raised on the [Issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues)
* For discussion or questions please use [the dedicated Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/catch-forum) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD)
* See [who else is using Catch2](docs/opensource-users.md#top)

The log shows that 11 test cases passed and 8 test cases failed, resulting in a non-zero exit code (10). Since not all tests passed, the overall execution is not considered complete. The issue is not with the environment setup or test execution logic itself, but with the test failures. To diagnose why these tests failed, please provide the actual content of the 'test patch' that was applied to 'projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Message.tests.cpp'. This will help determine if the patch was intended to fix existing failures or if it introduced new ones, and guide further investigation into the failing tests or the code under test."
