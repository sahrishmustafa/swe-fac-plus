  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `make` step due to C++ compilation errors. Specifically, `catch_fatal_condition.cpp` encountered issues where `MINSIGSTKSZ` was not a `constexpr` value, leading to errors regarding `call to non-'constexpr' function 'long int sysconf(int)'` and `size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression`. This indicates a compatibility problem between Catch2 version 2.7, the C++17 standard, and the specific compiler/libraries (glibc) provided by `ubuntu:22.04`.\n\nTo resolve this, please modify the Dockerfile to use `ubuntu:20.04` as the base image. This version of Ubuntu often provides a compiler and library environment that is more compatible with older projects like Catch2 2.7 in combination with C++17 expectations. This change should resolve the compilation errors during the build process.\n\n**Action:** Change `FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 ubuntu:22.04` to `FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 ubuntu:20.04`.",
