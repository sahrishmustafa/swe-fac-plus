The Dockerfile correctly set up the environment, and the evaluation script correctly executed the tests and captured the exit code. The failures are due to the test assertions themselves, not an issue with the environment setup or test execution process. To diagnose these failures further, it is necessary to understand the expected behavior of these specific test cases after the patch was applied. Please provide context on the purpose of the applied patch and/or the expected outcomes (pass/fail status) for the tests in 'projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Class.tests.cpp' and 'projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Misc.tests.cpp' to determine if the observed failures are intended or indicate an issue with the code or the patch itself.",
