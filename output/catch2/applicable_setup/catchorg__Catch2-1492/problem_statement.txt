If a specific section is specified, actually two test runs are carried out
## Description
If I like a test in a specific section to be run, I can do this with this command:
`./MyExe Test -c sa`

Surprisingly, this causes two test runs:
1. Test "Test" with section "sa"
2. Test "Test" without any sections

Is there a reason for the second empty test run? In my application where the initialisation for the test case is lengthy this behaviour is inconvenient.

### Steps to reproduce
Put some log output in the test case "Test" outside any sections.
