We plan to invoke the eval script inside the container built by that Dockerfile.\n\nYou will:\n1. Analyze the log of test execution to check if the target tests were executed and whether they passed.\n2. If the tests did not run correctly, determine whether the issue is related to:\n   - The **Dockerfile** (environment setup issues)\n   - The **evaluation script** (test execution issues)\n   - Missing information that needs to be collected\n\n3. Based on your analysis, provide **clear guidance** to the appropriate agent:\n   - `write_dockerfile_agent`\n   - `write_eval_script_agent`\n   - `context_retrieval_agent`\n\nYour findings and recommendations must be structured in a JSON format, ensuring efficient collaboration with other agents."

But if the dockerfile is not built successfully, you should analyze what issues happen.\n\n### **Step 1: Verify Test Execution**\n- Identify which test files were added or modified by the eval script.\n- Confirm that those tests were actually executed (they appear in the test log).\n- Check their pass/fail status:\n   - If all tests passed, report success.\n- Ensure there is at least some test output in the log:\n   - If no test output is found, set `is_finish = false` and include an instruction for write_eval_script_agent to revise the eval script so that tests actually run.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Problems**\n- If the tests failed due to **environment setup issues**, analyze whether the problem comes from:\n  - The **Dockerfile** (e.g., incorrect dependencies, wrong OS, missing configurations).\n  - The **evaluation script** (e.g., incorrect test commands, wrong paths, missing environment activation).\n- Sometimes, tests may fail due to incorrect versions of specific dependencies. Be sure to check the versions of critical dependencies to ensure compatibility.\n- If there are missing dependencies or unknown errors, consider whether additional context retrieval is required.\n- Tests should not be run in the Dockerfile**; skip tests during environment setup and run them in the evaluation script.\n- Note that the eval script MUST catch exit code after running tests, and echo \"OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc\". This is important for judge whether tests are run successfully.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan Corrective Actions**\n- If a fix is needed in the **Dockerfile**, provide guidance to `write_dockerfile_agent` on how to fix it.\n- If a fix is needed in the **evaluation script**, provide guidance to `write_eval_script_agent` on how to fix it.\n- If more information from the target repository is needed, provide guidance to `context_retrieval_agent` on what to collect.\n\n### **Output Format**\nProvide your answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"is_finish\": true/false,  # If tests passed and everything is correct, set this to true.\n    \"guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent\": \"<Provide detailed guidance if modifications are needed>\",\n    \"guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent\": \"<Provide detailed guidance if modifications are needed>\",\n    \"guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent\": \"<Specify what additional information from the target repository is needed, if any>\",\n}\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- If `is_finish` is `true`, all guidance fields can be empty.\n- Be specific in your guidance, providing detailed steps for the necessary fixes. Only provide guidance to the relevant agent based on the actual issue. For any agent not called, its guidance field must be empty. \n"

The compilation errors, such as \\\"call to non-'constexpr' function 'long int sysconf(int)'\\\" and \\\"size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression\\\", indicate an incompatibility between Catch2 v2.5.0's signal handling code and the C++17 standard combined with the compiler/headers in Ubuntu 22.04.\\n\\nWhile `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS=ON` was previously added to the CMake command with the intention of resolving this, the log shows a CMake warning: \\\"Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: CATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS\\\". This means CMake interpreted it as a CMake variable rather than a preprocessor definition required by Catch2.\\n\\nTo fix this, the `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS` preprocessor define needs to be explicitly passed to the C++ compiler via `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`. Modify the `cmake` command in the eval script as follows:\\n\\nOriginal line:\\ncmake -S .. -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS=OFF -DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=ON -DCATCH_ENABLE_WERROR=ON -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON -DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS=ON\\n\\nChange to:\\ncmake -S .. -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS=OFF -DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=ON -DCATCH_ENABLE_WERROR=ON -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\\\"-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS\\\"\\n\\nThis change ensures that the `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS` macro is defined for the compiler, which should prevent the signal-related compilation errors and allow the build to complete successfully. Once the build succeeds, `ctest` should be able to find and run the test executables, including those relevant to the target files.\",\n    \"guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent\": \"\"\n}"
