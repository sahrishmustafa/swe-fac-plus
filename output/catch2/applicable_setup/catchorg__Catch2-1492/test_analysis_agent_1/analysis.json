These errors (`error: call to non-'constexpr' function 'long int sysconf(int)'` and `error: size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression`) indicate a compatibility issue between Catch2 v2.5, the chosen C++14 standard, and the GCC 11.4.0 compiler provided by Ubuntu 22.04.\n\nTo resolve this, update the CMake configuration in the `eval_script` to use a more recent C++ standard, such as C++17. In C++17 and later, `sysconf` might be allowed in `constexpr` contexts in certain standard library implementations, or the underlying library issues might be mitigated. This is a common solution for such `constexpr` errors with older libraries and newer compilers.\n\n**Action:** Modify the `cmake` command in the `eval_script`:\n\nChange this line:\n`-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 \\\n`\nTo this:\n`-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \\\n`",
