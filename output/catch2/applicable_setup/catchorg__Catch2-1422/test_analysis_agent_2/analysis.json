This indicates that the GCC compiler (version 9.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04) treats a specific C++ warning as an error, which prevents the build from completing. To resolve this, you need to instruct CMake to disable this particular warning from being treated as an error. Modify the `cmake` command in Step 9/9 within the Dockerfile to add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error=redundant-move\"`. This flag will specifically tell the C++ compiler to ignore the `redundant-move` warning, preventing build failure.\n\nModified Dockerfile step:\n```dockerfile\n# Configure Catch2 with CMake (enabling testing and debug build type) and compile the project\n# -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON is crucial to ensure test executables are built.\n# -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug sets the build type for debugging.\n# -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error=redundant-move\" disables redundant-move warning from being treated as error.\nRUN cmake -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error=redundant-move\" .. \\\n    && cmake --build . -j $(nproc)\n```",
