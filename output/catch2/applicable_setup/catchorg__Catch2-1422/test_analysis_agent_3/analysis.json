This indicates that the `ctest -R \"CmdLine\"` command could not find any CTest-registered test entries matching the regex 'CmdLine'.\n\nFor Catch2 projects, unit test files like `projects/SelfTest/IntrospectiveTests/CmdLine.tests.cpp` are typically compiled into larger test executables (e.g., `SelfTest`), which are then registered as a single test with CTest. Individual source files or specific test cases within these executables are not usually separate CTest entries. The `SelfTest` executable is expected to contain the tests from `CmdLine.tests.cpp`.\n\nTo correctly execute these tests, you should:\n1. Run the `SelfTest` executable directly.\n2. Pass a filter argument to the `SelfTest` executable to specifically target the tests from `CmdLine.tests.cpp`.\n\n**Proposed modification to the eval script:**\n\nRemove the current `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -R \"CmdLine\"` command.\n\nReplace it with a direct execution of the `SelfTest` executable, which is located in `/testbed/build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`. You can pass `\"[CmdLine]\"` as an argument to the Catch2 test runner to filter for tests related to `CmdLine`, which is a common pattern for specifying tests from a particular source file or logic group in Catch2.\n\n```bash\n# Existing: Navigate to the build directory\ncd /testbed/build\n\n# Execute the SelfTest executable with a filter for CmdLine tests.\n# Ensure the path to SelfTest is correct relative to /testbed/build.\n./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"\nrc=$? # Capture the exit code of the test command immediately after execution\n\n# The rest of the script (echo OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE, cd /testbed, git checkout) remains the same.\n```\nThis change will execute the `SelfTest` suite and filter its internal tests, expecting output related to the tests in `CmdLine.tests.cpp`.",
