This indicates that the path used to invoke the `SelfTest` executable is incorrect. When Catch2 is built using CMake as done in the Dockerfile (`cmake --build .`), the `SelfTest` executable is typically placed directly inside the `build` directory (`/testbed/build/SelfTest`), not in a `projects/SelfTest` subdirectory within the `build` directory. Please modify the test execution command in the `eval.sh` script from `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest '[CmdLine]'` to `./SelfTest '[CmdLine]'`. This correction assumes the current working directory in the eval script is indeed `/testbed/build` (which it is, due to `cd build`).",
