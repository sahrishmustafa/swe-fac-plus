The error `/eval.sh: line 52: ./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest: Not a directory` indicates that the path `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` (relative to `/testbed/build`) does not point to an executable file or does not exist. \n\nPlease modify the evaluation script as follows:\n1.  **Verify Executable Location:** Before the line `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest '[CmdLine]'`, add a diagnostic command to find the actual location of the `SelfTest` executable. For instance, add `find . -name SelfTest -type f` to list all files named 'SelfTest' within the current (build) directory. This will help confirm where CMake placed the executable during the build process.\n2.  **Correct Test Command:** Based on the output of the `find` command, update the execution command `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest '[CmdLine]'` to use the correct relative path to the `SelfTest` executable. It is common for CMake-built executables like `SelfTest` to be located directly in the build directory (e.g., `./SelfTest`) or possibly a `bin/` subdirectory, rather than mirroring the source directory structure like `projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` at runtime.",
