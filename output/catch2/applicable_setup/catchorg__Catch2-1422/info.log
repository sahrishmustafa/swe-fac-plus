- C++11 features are required (e.g., cxx_alignas, cxx_auto_type, cxx_lambdas, cxx_rvalue_references).

Runtime Requirements:
- Python (for tests, if `BUILD_TESTING` and `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` are ON and `NOT_SUBPROJECT`).

Build Steps:
- The project uses CMake. Typical build steps are:
  1. `mkdir build`
  2. `cd build`
  3. `cmake ..`
  4. `cmake --build .` (or `make`, `ninja`, etc., depending on your CMake generator)

Testing:
- Test framework: CTest integrated with CMake.
- Prerequisites for tests: Python interpreter must be found (`find_package(PythonInterp)`).
- Test command:
  - After building: `ctest`
  - Ensure `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` CMake option is `ON` (which it is by default).
    This option can be set during CMake configuration: `cmake -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON ..`

- clang-3.5, clang-3.6, clang-3.8, clang-3.9, clang-4.0, clang-5.0, clang-6.0
- g++-4.8, g++-4.9, g++-5, g++-6, g++-7, g++-8
- lcov
- libstdc++-6-dev
- libstdc++-8-dev
- valgrind

Key Environment Variables (set per build matrix entry):
- `COMPILER`: e.g., `clang++-3.5`, `g++-7`, `clang++`
- `CPP14`: `1` (if C++14 support is enabled)
- `CPP17`: `1` (if C++17 support is enabled)
- `EXAMPLES`: `1` (if examples are built)
- `COVERAGE`: `1` (if coverage is enabled)
- `EXTRAS`: `1` (if extra tests are built)
- `VALGRIND`: `1` (if Valgrind checks are enabled)

Environment Setup:
- `export CXX=${COMPILER}` (Sets the C++ compiler based on the `COMPILER` env var).
- On Linux, CMake 3.8.2 is downloaded and added to PATH.
- On OSX, CMake is installed via Homebrew if not found.
- Python script `scripts/generateSingleHeader.py` is executed to regenerate a single header file.

Build Commands:
- `cmake -H. -BBuild-Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -Wdev -DUSE_CPP14=${CPP14} -DUSE_CPP17=${CPP17} -DCATCH_USE_VALGRIND=${VALGRIND} -DCATCH_BUILD_EXAMPLES=${EXAMPLES} -DCATCH_ENABLE_COVERAGE=${COVERAGE} -DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=${EXTRAS}`
- `cmake -H. -BBuild-Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Wdev -DUSE_CPP14=${CPP14}`
- `cd Build-Debug && make -j 2`
- `cd ../Build-Release && make -j 2`

Test Execution Commands:
- Test framework: CTest
- Common test command:
  - `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j 2` (executed for both Debug and Release builds)
- Coverage specific commands (Linux only, when `COVERAGE=1`):
  - `make gcov`
  - `make lcov`
  - `bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -X gcov`
