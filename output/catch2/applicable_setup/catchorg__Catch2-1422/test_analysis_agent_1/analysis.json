The errors indicate issues with `constexpr` usage and array sizing related to `MINSIGSTKSZ` in `catch_fatal_condition.cpp`. This suggests a compatibility problem between Catch2 version 2.4 and the default C++ compiler (g++-11) on Ubuntu 22.04. To resolve this, it is recommended to change the base image to an older Ubuntu version that ships with an older, more compatible GCC compiler version. Please change the base image from `ubuntu:22.04` to `ubuntu:20.04`.",
