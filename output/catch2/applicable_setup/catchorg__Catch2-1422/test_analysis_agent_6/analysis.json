Based on typical CMake build configurations for Catch2, especially when `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set, the executables are generally placed directly in the build directory (`/testbed/build/`) or sometimes in a `bin/` subdirectory within `build/`. It is less common for Catch2's `SelfTest` executable to be directly placed in a `Debug/` subdirectory under `build/` unless specific CMake output directories are explicitly configured.\n\nTo resolve this, please modify the `eval.sh` script to run the `SelfTest` executable directly from the `/testbed/build` directory, without the `Debug/` subdirectory. Change the command `cd build` followed by `./Debug/SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"` to `./SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"` (assuming you are already in the `/testbed/build` directory as per the `cd build` command which is correct.)",
