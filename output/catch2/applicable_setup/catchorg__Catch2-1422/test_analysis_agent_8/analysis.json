When Catch2's `SelfTest` project is built with CMake from the `/testbed/build` directory, the `SelfTest` executable is typically placed directly in the top-level build directory, i.e., `/testbed/build/SelfTest`, not under a mirrored source path like `projects/SelfTest/`.\n\n**Action:** Modify the eval script to execute the `SelfTest` executable from its correct location within the build directory. The command should be `./SelfTest '[CmdLine]'` instead of `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest '[CmdLine]'`.\n\n**Revised Line (in eval script, after `cd build`):**\n```bash\n./SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"\n```",
