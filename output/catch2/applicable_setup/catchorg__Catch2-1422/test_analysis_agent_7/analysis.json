This suggests that 'SelfTest' is not directly under '/testbed/build', but rather in a subdirectory created during the CMake build process. For Catch2, the 'SelfTest' executable is typically built into the `projects/SelfTest` subdirectory within the main build directory. Please modify the eval script to call the executable from its correct relative path. Specifically, change line 51 from `./SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"` to `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"`.",
