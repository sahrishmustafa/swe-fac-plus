This is likely because the executable is not directly in the `/testbed/build` directory where the script attempts to run it.\n\nGiven that the Dockerfile configures CMake with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, it is common for the compiled executables to be placed in a `Debug/` subdirectory within the build directory. Therefore, the `SelfTest` executable is most likely located at `/testbed/build/Debug/SelfTest`.\n\nPlease modify the evaluation script to execute the test from this corrected path. Specifically, change `cd build` and then `./SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"` to `cd build` and then `./Debug/SelfTest \"[CmdLine]\"`.",
