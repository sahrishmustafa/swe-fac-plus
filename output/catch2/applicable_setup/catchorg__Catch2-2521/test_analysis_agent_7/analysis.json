This indicates that `cmake --build build --target test -j$(nproc)` is an incorrect command to run during the Dockerfile's build phase. The `test` target is typically associated with `ctest` for test *execution*, not for *building* components. The Dockerfile should only be responsible for setting up the environment and compiling the project (which `cmake --build build --target all -j$(nproc)` already does, assuming it compiles test executables as part of 'all' when `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON`). Test execution should always be handled by the evaluation script using `ctest`. Please remove `&& cmake --build build --target test -j$(nproc)` from the last `RUN` command in the Dockerfile.",
