  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile's build process, specifically `cmake --build build --target all`, is not resulting in the successful compilation and registration of Catch2's internal self-test executable, typically named `SelfTest`. This executable contains the library's unit tests and is crucial for `ctest` to find and run any tests. Although `-DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` is set during CMake configuration, the build log indicates that `SelfTest` was not built as part of the `all` target. \n\nTo resolve this, ensure the `SelfTest` executable is explicitly built during the Dockerfile's build phase. This will make the tests discoverable by `ctest`.\n\n**Action:**\n1. Locate the line in the Dockerfile responsible for configuring and building Catch2:\n   `RUN mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON && cmake --build build --target all -j$(nproc)`\n2. Modify this line to explicitly build the `SelfTest` target instead of, or in addition to, the `all` target:\n   `RUN mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON && cmake --build build --target SelfTest -j$(nproc)`\n\nThis change ensures that `SelfTest` is compiled, making its associated tests visible to `ctest` when executed by the evaluation script.",
