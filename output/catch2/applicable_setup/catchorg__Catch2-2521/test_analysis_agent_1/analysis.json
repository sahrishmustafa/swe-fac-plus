The test log shows 'No tests were found!!!' when 'ctest -VV' was executed, indicating that CTest could not locate any tests to run. Although 'CATCH_BUILD_TESTING' is typically 'ON' by default, it might have been implicitly disabled or not fully honored in the current build environment. To ensure tests are properly configured and built, explicitly set the `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` CMake option to `ON` during the initial `cmake` configuration. Modify the Dockerfile's `cmake` command from `cmake -S . -B build` to `cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON`.",
