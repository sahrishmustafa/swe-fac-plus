  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed because the target 'SelfTest' attempted in the last `cmake --build` command does not exist. When `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` is used with CMake, the test executables (like Catch2's SelfTest) are typically built as part of the default build process (i.e., `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`). They are then meant to be discovered and run by `ctest`, not built as a separate, explicit target outside of the main build. \n\nRemove the incorrect `--target SelfTest` from the final `RUN` command in the Dockerfile. The line should be:\n`RUN mkdir build \\\n    && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON \\\n    && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`\n\nThis will ensure that the Catch2 library and its self-tests are properly compiled during the Dockerfile build, and the `eval_script` can then correctly invoke `ctest` to run them.",
