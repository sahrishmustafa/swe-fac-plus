  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The current Dockerfile configures Catch2 with `DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON`, but the subsequent `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` command only builds the default targets (Catch2 library and Catch2WithMain executable). It does not explicitly build the `SelfTest` executable or other test targets required by CTest. As a result, when `ctest -VV` is invoked in the eval script, it reports 'No tests were found!!!'.\n\nTo fix this, modify the Dockerfile to explicitly build the 'test' target after the initial CMake configuration and build. This will ensure that Catch2's self-test executables are compiled and available for `ctest` to discover and run. Add an additional `cmake --build` command specifically for the `test` target.\n\nHere's how to modify the Dockerfile's build step:\n\nOriginal:\n```dockerfile\nRUN mkdir build \\\n    && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON \\\n    && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)\n```\n\nModified (add a build step for the 'test' target):\n```dockerfile\nRUN mkdir build \\\n    && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON \\\n    && cmake --build build --target all -j$(nproc) \\\n    && cmake --build build --target test -j$(nproc)\n```\n\nThis ensures that all default targets are built, and specifically, the test executables are also compiled.",
