  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed at `Step 8/8` with the error `gmake: *** No rule to make target 'SelfTest'. Stop.`.\nThis indicates that the target 'SelfTest' is not a valid build target for this version of Catch2 using `cmake --build`. While `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` correctly configures CMake to include tests, `cmake --build build --target all` should be sufficient to compile all necessary binaries, including the Catch2 self-test executable, if it's part of the 'all' target. The explicit call to build `SelfTest` is causing the failure.\n\n**Action:** Remove `--target SelfTest` from the final `RUN` command in the Dockerfile. The line should be:\n`RUN mkdir build \\\n    && cmake -S . -B build -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON \\\n    && cmake --build build --target all -j$(nproc)`",
