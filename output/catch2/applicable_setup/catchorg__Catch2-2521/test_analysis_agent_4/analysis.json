The test log shows that only static libraries (`libCatch2.a` and `libCatch2Main.a`) were built, and `ctest` subsequently reported \"No tests were found!!!\" This indicates that the necessary test binaries are not being generated. Ensure that Catch2's self-tests (e.g., the `SelfTest` executable) are explicitly built and discoverable by CTest. You may need to add an additional `cmake --build build --target SelfTest` command (if such a target exists for Catch2 v3.1) or investigate why `DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` is not leading to the compilation of executable test targets by default.",
