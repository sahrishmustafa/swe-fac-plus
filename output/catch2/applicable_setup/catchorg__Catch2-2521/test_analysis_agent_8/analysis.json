This indicates that the test executables themselves were not built during the Dockerfile's setup phase, even though CATCH_BUILD_TESTING was set to ON. While `cmake --build build --target all` was performed, it seems that for this specific Catch2 commit, the 'all' target does not include the self-test executables (like 'SelfTest').\n\nTo resolve this, explicitly build the 'SelfTest' target (which is Catch2's internal test executable) in the Dockerfile after the initial CMake configuration and 'all' target build. This will ensure the test binaries are present for ctest to discover and execute.\n\nAdd the following command after `cmake --build build --target all -j$(nproc)`:\n`RUN cmake --build build --target SelfTest -j$(nproc)`",
