This indicates that the compiler process (cc1plus) was terminated by the operating system, most likely due to running out of memory (OOM). This typically happens when too many compilation jobs run in parallel, consuming excessive memory. To fix this, reduce the number of parallel jobs for the 'make' command.\n\nModify the line `make -j$(nproc)` to `make -j1` or `make -j2` (or a small fixed number) to limit parallel compilation and reduce memory pressure. Starting with `-j1` is safest to confirm it resolves the OOM, then gradually increase if higher concurrency is desired and resources allow.\n\nThe `ctest` command was not reached and therefore the `OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE` was not echoed. This will be resolved once the compilation issue is fixed and `ctest` can execute.",
