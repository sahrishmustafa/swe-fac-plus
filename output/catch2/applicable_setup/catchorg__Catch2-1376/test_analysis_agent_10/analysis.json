  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The test log shows that the command `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` failed with the error `/eval.sh: line 46: ./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest: Not a directory` (exit code 126). This indicates that when the eval script tries to execute `/testbed/Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`, that path resolves to a directory instead of the expected executable file. This implies that the `cmake --build Build` step in the Dockerfile did not produce the `SelfTest` executable at the expected location (`Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`) or generated a directory structure where an executable should be.\n\nTo fix this, please modify the Dockerfile to ensure the `SelfTest` executable is correctly built and placed. After the `cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)` command in the Dockerfile, add a debugging step to inspect the contents of the `Build` directory, specifically around `Build/projects/SelfTest/`, to verify the actual location and type of the generated `SelfTest` artifact. For example, add:\n\n`RUN ls -l Build/projects/SelfTest/ || true`\n`RUN file Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest || true`\n`RUN find Build -name 'SelfTest*'`\n\nAnalyze the output of these commands during the Dockerfile build process. If `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` is indeed a directory, or if the executable is located elsewhere (e.g., `Build/projects/SelfTest/bin/SelfTest`), adjust the CMake configuration in the Dockerfile to ensure the `SelfTest` executable is output directly at `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` with execute permissions, or determine the correct path and communicate it for the eval script to use.",
