  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The Dockerfile build failed during the `cmake --build Build` step with a compilation error: `error: redundant move in return statement [-Werror=redundant-move]` in `catch_session.cpp`. This indicates that the compiler is treating warnings as errors (`cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors`). This is likely due to the default compiler settings for Ubuntu 22.04 and Catch2's internal build flags. To resolve this, modify the `cmake` command in the Dockerfile's last `RUN` instruction to explicitly disable this specific warning being treated as an error by adding `-Wno-error=redundant-move` to the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`. The updated command should look like this:\n\n`RUN python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py \\\n    && mkdir Build \\\n    && cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS -Wno-error=redundant-move\" \\\n    && cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)`",
