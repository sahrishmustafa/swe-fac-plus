This indicates that the `Catch_DiscoverTests` mechanism, which relies on running the `SelfTest` executable (typically located at `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`), failed to correctly discover and register tests with CTest. This failure most likely stems from an issue with the Dockerfile's build process, where the `SelfTest` executable either:\n1. Was not built successfully or is corrupted.\n2. Crashes or does not run as expected when invoked by CTest for test discovery (e.g., missing runtime dependencies, or an issue with the build flags like `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS` affecting the discovery process).\n\nPlease ensure that after the `cmake --build Build` step, the `SelfTest` executable is correctly built, executable, and capable of listing its internal tests (e.g., by manually running `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest --list-tests`). Verify that all necessary runtime dependencies required for executing the compiled Catch2 SelfTest application are installed in the Docker environment. The current `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` should be reviewed to confirm they do not inadvertently cause runtime issues for the test executable's self-discovery.",
