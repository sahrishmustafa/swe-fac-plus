Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu is a strong candidate, a modern Ubuntu LTS like 22.04 would be suitable given the compiler versions used in `.travis.yml`).\n*   **Core Dependencies:**\n    *   **C++ Compiler:** GCC/G++ (e.g., `g++` from `build-essential` package). The project requires C++11, and modern GCC versions on Ubuntu 22.04 will satisfy this.\n    *   **CMake:** Minimum `3.5` required, a recent version will be installed from apt.\n    *   **Python 3:** Required for `scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`.\n*   **Build Tools:** `make` (part of `build-essential`).\n*   **No specific environment variables** are needed for a basic build and test run, as the defaults on the chosen OS and compiler will be sufficient.\n\n**2. Test Execution (for Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Pre-test Build Steps:**\n    1.  `python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`: Essential step to prepare the Catch2 single header file.\n    2.  `mkdir Build`: Create a build directory for out-of-source compilation.\n    3.  `cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`: Configure the project using CMake for a debug build. This step ensures test targets are discovered and set up (`BUILD_TESTING` is implicitly ON).\n    4.  `cd Build`: Navigate into the build directory.\n    5.  `make -j $(nproc)`: Compile the project, including the `SelfTest` executables which contain the target test file.\n*   **Test Runner:** `ctest` (part of CMake).\n*   **Test Command:** `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc)`\n    *   This command runs all tests defined in the CMake project, which will include `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp` as it's part of the default `SelfTest` suite.\n    *   `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` is crucial for seeing test output on failure.\n    *   `-j $(nproc)` allows parallel test execution.\n\n"

You must **execute only the specified target test files**, rather than running all tests in the repository.  \n   - Running all tests can be highly time-consuming and unnecessary.  \n   - Ensure that only the **required test cases** are executed based on the provided test file list.  \n\n2. **Optimize execution efficiency by combining multiple test commands into a single command** whenever possible.  \n   - Avoid running multiple separate test commands if they can be executed in one batch.  \n   - This reduces redundant initialization overhead and speeds up execution.  \n\n3. **Ensure that the output of the evaluation script is concise and structured**, making it easier for the **test log analysis agent** to process.  \n   - Avoid excessive logging, unnecessary debug information, or verbose output.  \n\n4. **Follow the structure of the reference evaluation script or eval script skeleton whenever available.  \n   - Use **a simple, minimalistic structure** similar to the reference eval script to ensure clarity and maintainability.  \n   - The script should be easy to modify and extend without unnecessary complexity.  \n\n5. **The actual test patch content is omitted here for brevity (marked with [CONTENT OF TEST PATCH] placeholder).\n    -You must generate the complete git apply command structure, including the heredoc syntax with delimiter (EOF_114329324912).\n\n    -The placeholder will be programmatically replaced with the actual patch content during script execution.\n\n    -Example structure:\n    git apply -v - <<'EOF_114329324912'\n[CONTENT OF TEST PATCH]\nEOF_114329324912\n\n6.
