  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The test execution failed with the error \"/eval.sh: line 45: ./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest: Not a directory\". This indicates that the path to the 'SelfTest' executable is incorrect or that 'projects/SelfTest/SelfTest' within the 'Build' directory is actually a directory, not the executable. Based on typical CMake build structures for Catch2, the 'SelfTest' executable is usually placed directly under the 'Build' directory (e.g., 'Build/SelfTest') or a 'Build/bin' subdirectory, not recreating the full source path. Please modify the test execution command from './projects/SelfTest/SelfTest' to './SelfTest' within the 'Build' directory. The line to change is: './projects/SelfTest/SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success' to './SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success'.",
