- Minimum CMake version: 3.5
- Compiler must support C++11 features (see C++ Standard below).
- Warnings are treated as errors by default (`CATCH_ENABLE_WERROR` option is ON).

C++ Standard:
- Requires C++11 or newer, as indicated by the dependency on a comprehensive set of C++11 features: `cxx_alignas`, `cxx_alignof`, `cxx_attributes`, `cxx_auto_type`, `cxx_constexpr`, `cxx_defaulted_functions`, `cxx_deleted_functions`, `cxx_final`, `cxx_lambdas`, `cxx_noexcept`, `cxx_override`, `cxx_range_for`, `cxx_rvalue_references`, `cxx_static_assert`, `cxx_strong_enums`, `cxx_trailing_return_types`, `cxx_unicode_literals`, `cxx_user_literals`, `cxx_variadic_macros`.

Testing:
- Prerequisite: Python (PythonInterp) is required for tests. A fatal error is raised if Python is not found.
- Test framework: CTest is used (`include(CTest)`).
- Test Definition/Build:
    - The `SelfTest` project is built by default if `BUILD_TESTING` and `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING` are enabled, and Catch2 is not a subproject.
    - Tests are typically located within the `projects` subdirectory (e.g., `projects/SelfTest`).
    - An option `CATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS` exists to build additional tests from `projects/ExtraTests`, but it is OFF by default.

<a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v2.4.0/catch.hpp">The latest version of the single header can be downloaded directly using this link</a>

## Catch2 is released!

If you've been using an earlier version of Catch, please see the
Breaking Changes section of [the release notes](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
before moving to Catch2. You might also like to read [this blog post](http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2017/11/3/catch2-released.html) for more details.

## What's the Catch?

Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a
multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports Objective-C
(and maybe C).
It is primarily distributed as a single header file, although certain
extensions may require additional headers.

## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md#top)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#top) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md#top) - all the details

## More
* Issues and bugs can be raised on the [Issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues)
* For discussion or questions please use [the dedicated Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/catch-forum) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD)
* See [who else is using Catch2](docs/opensource-users.md#top)

Environment Setup (for Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu is a strong candidate, a modern Ubuntu LTS like 22.04 would be suitable given the compiler versions used in `.travis.yml`).\n*   **Core Dependencies:**\n    *   **C++ Compiler:** GCC/G++ (e.g., `g++` from `build-essential` package). The project requires C++11, and modern GCC versions on Ubuntu 22.04 will satisfy this.\n    *   **CMake:** Minimum `3.5` required, a recent version will be installed from apt.\n    *   **Python 3:** Required for `scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`.\n*   **Build Tools:** `make` (part of `build-essential`).\n*   **No specific environment variables** are needed for a basic build and test run, as the defaults on the chosen OS and compiler will be sufficient.\n\n**2. Test Execution (for Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Pre-test Build Steps:**\n    1.  `python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`: Essential step to prepare the Catch2 single header file.\n    2.  `mkdir Build`: Create a build directory for out-of-source compilation.\n    3.  `cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`: Configure the project using CMake for a debug build. This step ensures test targets are discovered and set up (`BUILD_TESTING` is implicitly ON).\n    4.  `cd Build`: Navigate into the build directory.\n    5.  `make -j $(nproc)`: Compile the project, including the `SelfTest` executables which contain the target test file.\n*   **Test Runner:** `ctest` (part of CMake).\n*   **Test Command:** `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc)`\n    *   This command runs all tests defined in the CMake project, which will include `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp` as it's part of the default `SelfTest` suite.\n    *   `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` is crucial for seeing test output on failure.\n    *   `-j $(nproc)` allows parallel test execution.",

The error messages 'call to non-constexpr function' and 'size of array is not an integral constant-expression' in `catch_fatal_condition.cpp` indicate a compilation issue related to how signal handling is configured. The CMake warning 'Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: CATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS' is crucial here, as it shows that the intended flag to disable POSIX signal handling was passed as a CMake variable but not utilized by Catch2's CMake setup for this version.\n\nTo fix this, the `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS` flag needs to be passed as a preprocessor definition directly to the C++ compiler, not as a CMake variable that Catch2's CMakeLists.txt does not recognize. This can be achieved by adding it to `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.\n\n**Action:** Modify Step 7/7 in the Dockerfile, specifically the `cmake -H. -BBuild` command. Remove `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS=TRUE` and instead add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS\"` to ensure this preprocessor definition is passed to the C++ compiler during the build.\n\n**Proposed change to Dockerfile (Step 7/7):**\n```dockerfile\n# Prepare and build the project as per Catch2's requirements\n# This includes generating the single header and compiling the project, including test executables.\nRUN python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py \\\n    && mkdir Build \\\n    && cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS\" \\\n    && cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)\n```",

The error message `/eval.sh: line 46: ./SelfTest: No such file or directory` indicates that when the script attempts to run `./SelfTest` from within the `/testbed/Build` directory, the executable is not in that specific location.\n\nBased on Catch2's build structure with `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` and the `cmake` commands, the `SelfTest` executable is typically located at `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` (relative to the repository root). \n\nTo fix this, modify the `eval.sh` script to use the correct path to the `SelfTest` executable. Instead of `cd Build` followed by `./SelfTest`, the script should either:\n1. Change directory to `Build/projects/SelfTest` before running `./SelfTest` (e.g., `cd Build/projects/SelfTest` then `./SelfTest ...`).\n2. Call `SelfTest` with its full relative path from the `Build` directory (e.g., `cd Build` then `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest ...`).\n\nThe second option is generally cleaner and less prone to issues with relative paths in complex scripts. Therefore, keep `cd Build` and change the executable path.\n\nSpecifically, change the line:\n`./SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success`\nTo:\n`./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success`",

This indicates that when the eval script tries to execute `/testbed/Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`, that path resolves to a directory instead of the expected executable file. This implies that the `cmake --build Build` step in the Dockerfile did not produce the `SelfTest` executable at the expected location (`Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest`) or generated a directory structure where an executable should be.\n\nTo fix this, please modify the Dockerfile to ensure the `SelfTest` executable is correctly built and placed. After the `cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)` command in the Dockerfile, add a debugging step to inspect the contents of the `Build` directory, specifically around `Build/projects/SelfTest/`, to verify the actual location and type of the generated `SelfTest` artifact. For example, add:\n\n`RUN ls -l Build/projects/SelfTest/ || true`\n`RUN file Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest || true`\n`RUN find Build -name 'SelfTest*'`\n\nAnalyze the output of these commands during the Dockerfile build process. If `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` is indeed a directory, or if the executable is located elsewhere (e.g., `Build/projects/SelfTest/bin/SelfTest`), adjust the CMake configuration in the Dockerfile to ensure the `SelfTest` executable is output directly at `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` with execute permissions, or determine the correct path and communicate it for the eval script to use.",
