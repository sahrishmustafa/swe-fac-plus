The error message `/eval.sh: line 46: ./SelfTest: No such file or directory` indicates that when the script attempts to run `./SelfTest` from within the `/testbed/Build` directory, the executable is not in that specific location.\n\nBased on Catch2's build structure with `CATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON` and the `cmake` commands, the `SelfTest` executable is typically located at `Build/projects/SelfTest/SelfTest` (relative to the repository root). \n\nTo fix this, modify the `eval.sh` script to use the correct path to the `SelfTest` executable. Instead of `cd Build` followed by `./SelfTest`, the script should either:\n1. Change directory to `Build/projects/SelfTest` before running `./SelfTest` (e.g., `cd Build/projects/SelfTest` then `./SelfTest ...`).\n2. Call `SelfTest` with its full relative path from the `Build` directory (e.g., `cd Build` then `./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest ...`).\n\nThe second option is generally cleaner and less prone to issues with relative paths in complex scripts. Therefore, keep `cd Build` and change the executable path.\n\nSpecifically, change the line:\n`./SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success`\nTo:\n`./projects/SelfTest/SelfTest \"[file:projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringGeneral.tests.cpp]\" --success`",
