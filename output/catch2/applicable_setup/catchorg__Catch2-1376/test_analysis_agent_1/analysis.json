This indicates an incompatibility between Catch2 v2.4.0 and the GCC 11 compiler found in Ubuntu 22.04 regarding stricter C++ standards and `constexpr` evaluation. To resolve this, disable POSIX signal handling in Catch2 during the CMake configuration step.\n\n**Action:** Modify Step 7/7 of the Dockerfile. Update the `cmake` command that configures the project to include the `-DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS=TRUE` flag.\n\n**Original line:**\n```dockerfile\n    && cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \\\n```\n\n**Modified line:**\n```dockerfile\n    && cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCATCH_CONFIG_NO_POSIX_SIGNALS=TRUE \\\n```",
