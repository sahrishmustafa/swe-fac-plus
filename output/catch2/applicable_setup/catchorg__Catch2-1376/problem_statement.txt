std::string_view is stringified without quotes
## Description
`std::string_view` probably uses some fallback stringification, and is expanded without quotes (and also bypasses pretty printing of invisibles).


### Steps to reproduce
```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>

#include <string>
#include <string_view>

TEST_CASE("string_view == string") {
    std::string s = "foo";
    std::string_view v = s;

    CHECK(s == v);
}
```
run with `-s`:
```
PASSED:
  CHECK( s == v )
with expansion:
  "foo" == foo
```
