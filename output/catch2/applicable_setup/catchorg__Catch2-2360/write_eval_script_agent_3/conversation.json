This means that `approve.py` runs before `ctest` has a chance to generate the new '.unapproved.txt' files that reflect the patched code's output. Consequently, the `approve.py` script correctly reports \"no files to approve\" at that point, but the subsequent `ctest` run discovers and reports the baseline mismatches, causing the 'ApprovalTests' test to fail.\n\nTo resolve this, move the `python3 /testbed/tools/scripts/approve.py` command to immediately follow the `ctest -C Release -j $(nproc)` command. This ensures that `approve.py` is run *after* `ctest` has generated any new unapproved baseline files (if the patch indeed changed test outputs) allowing it to approve them for future test runs.\n\n"
