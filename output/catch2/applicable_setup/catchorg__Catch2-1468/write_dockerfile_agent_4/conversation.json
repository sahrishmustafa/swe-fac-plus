Environment Setup (Dockerfile):**\n\n*   **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu is a good base, an LTS version like 22.04 would be appropriate).\n*   **Core Tools/Languages**:\n    *   **C++ Compiler**: GCC (e.g., `g++-9` or newer for C++17 support) or Clang.\n    *   **Python**: Python 3.x (for build scripts and Conan).\n    *   **Build System**: CMake (minimum 3.5, Travis uses 3.8.2), Make.\n*   **Dependencies (Apt packages)**:\n    *   `build-essential` (provides `g++`, `make`, etc.)\n    *   `cmake`\n    *   `python3`\n    *   `python3-pip`\n    *   `git`\n    *   `lcov` (optional, for coverage)\n    *   `valgrind` (optional, for memory checks)\n*   **Dependencies (Pip packages)**:\n    *   `conan`\n    *   `conan-package-tools`\n*   **Environment Variables**: `CXX` variable needs to be set to the chosen C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).\n*   **Working Directory**: The repository should be cloned into a suitable working directory (e.g., `/app`).\n\n**2. Test Execution (Evaluation Script):**\n\n*   **Pre-build Steps**:\n    1.  Ensure the repository is cloned and the shell is at the root of the repository.\n    2.  Execute the single header generation script: `python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py`\n*   **Build Steps**:\n    1.  Create a build directory: `mkdir Build-Debug`\n    2.  Change into the build directory: `cd Build-Debug`\n    3.  Configure CMake:\n        ```bash\n        cmake .. \\\n            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \\\n            -DUSE_CPP14=ON \\\n            -DUSE_CPP17=ON \\\n            -DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=ON \\\n            -DCATCH_ENABLE_WERROR=ON \\\n            -DCATCH_BUILD_TESTING=ON\n        ```\n    4.  Compile the project: `make -j \"$(nproc)\"`\n*   **Test Execution**:\n    1.  Ensure current directory is `Build-Debug`.\n    2.  Run the CTest suite: `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j \"$(nproc)\"`\n*   **Target Test Files Handling**:\n    *   The files `docs/test-cases-and-sections.md`, `docs/test-fixtures.md`, and `include/internal/catch_test_registry.h` are documentation or header files and are not executable tests.\n    *   `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Class.tests.cpp` and `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/Misc.tests.cpp` are actual C++ test source files. These will be compiled into executables by CMake and automatically discovered and run by the `ctest` command as part of the overall test suite. There is no need for specific commands to run just these files, as `ctest` handles the full test discovery and execution.\n\n"

You are FORBIDDEN to run tests in the dockerfile, tests will be run using eval script.\n2. When building the Dockerfile, you MUST prioritize using package managers such as Conda, Maven, or NPM etc to set up the environment efficiently.\n3. Ensure shell compatibility by using `/bin/bash` as the default shell environment to avoid runtime issues.  For example, **do not use `FROM alpine:latest`**, as it lacks `/bin/bash` by default, which may cause runtime errors. Instead, use a base image like `ubuntu:22.04` or `debian:bookworm` that includes Bash by default.\n4. Pay more attention when using Ubuntu-based images**, as different versions may have variations in default packages, dependency resolution, and package manager behavior, which could lead to unexpected errors.\n5. DO NOT use `COPY` to copy local files** into the Docker container.  \n   - For example, avoid using `COPY package.json /testbed/` or `COPY requirements.txt /testbed/`.  \n   - Instead, all files should be retrieved directly by **cloning the repository** inside the container to ensure a fully reproducible environment.\n6. DO NOT run tests in the Dockerfile**.  \n   - Do not include commands like `npm test`, `pytest`, or `mvn test` in the Dockerfile.  \n   - Tests will be executed separately, and running them during the Docker build stage is an unnecessary overhead.\n   - You can skip tests during environment setup because this is not your job.\n\n7. If there is a reference Dockerfile, use it as a guideline.   \n8. Do not use ENTRYPOINT.\n9. Please install necessary essential tools and libraries required for development and runtime, such as git etc.\n10. When setting up dependencies for the target repository (e.g., `torch 3.33`), **DO NOT** install the package directly from external registries (e.g., PyPI, NPM, Maven Central) using commands like `pip install <package>` (e.g., `pip install torch`).  \n   Instead, **you can install the repository itself in development mode** (`pip install -e .` for Python, `npm link` for Node.js, or `mvn install` for Java) to ensure that the local repository\u2019s code is correctly referenced during execution.\n   **Why is this important?**  \n   - If you modify the repository\u2019s source code but have already installed a pre-built package from the registry, your system may load the installed package instead of your local code, **leading to incorrect test results and making debugging difficult**.  \n   - Using development mode installation (`pip install -e .`, `npm link`, `mvn install`) ensures that the system always references the latest local repository code, preventing version mismatches and ensuring that modifications are properly reflected in subsequent tests.\n\n\n\n### **Example Format:**\nThe Dockerfile must be wrapped in `<dockerfile>` tags.

If the Dockerfile is building a project that is itself a PyPI package (e.g., black, flake8, mypy, etc.), and the repository is cloned and installed with `pip install -e .`, then:\n- **Do NOT pre-install the same package from PyPI** using `pip install black` or similar. This is redundant and can lead to version conflicts or incorrect test behavior.\n- Always assume the cloned repo is the authoritative source of truth.\n\n2. **Do NOT run tests directly inside the Dockerfile** (e.g., avoid adding `RUN pytest` or `RUN make test` inside the Dockerfile):\n- Testing should be performed **after** the image is built (in CI pipeline or post-build validation step), not during image creation.\n- Embedding tests in the Dockerfile breaks caching and slows down builds.\n\nReturn modified dockerfile in defined format. Wrap results in <dockerfile></dockerfile>.\n"
