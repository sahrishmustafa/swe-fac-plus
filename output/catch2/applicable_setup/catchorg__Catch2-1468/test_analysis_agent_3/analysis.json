This indicates a compiler compatibility issue with Catch2 v2.5.0. Although C++14 is specified, the g++-9 compiler might be too strict or interpret certain constructs differently for this version of Catch2. To resolve this, downgrade the C++ compiler to an older, more compatible version. \n\n**Action:**\n1. Modify the `apt install` command to install `g++-7` instead of `g++-9`.\n2. Update the `ENV CXX` variable to `g++-7`.",
