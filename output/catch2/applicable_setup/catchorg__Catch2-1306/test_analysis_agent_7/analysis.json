This typically happens when Python tries to handle non-ASCII characters in an environment where the default encoding is 'ascii'. To fix this, set the locale environment variables to a UTF-8 locale before running the Python script. Add the following lines after the `ENV TZ=\"Etc/UTC\"` line:\n\nENV LANG C.UTF-8\nENV LC_ALL C.UTF-8\n\nThis will ensure that Python uses UTF-8 for encoding/decoding, resolving the Unicode error.",
