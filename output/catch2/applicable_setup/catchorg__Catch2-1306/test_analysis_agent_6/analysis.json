  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The build failed due to `-Werror` being active, specifically a `redundant-move` warning being treated as an error by `cc1plus`. This suggests that the version of `Catch2` (2.2) might not be fully compatible with the compiler version provided by Ubuntu 20.04 (typically GCC 9 or 10), which introduces new warnings or enforces `Werror` more aggressively. Although `-Wno-error` flags were attempted in both the Dockerfile and eval script, they were not sufficient.\n\nTo address this, change the base image from `ubuntu:20.04` to `ubuntu:18.04`. Ubuntu 18.04 typically ships with an older GCC version (e.g., GCC 7.5.0) which is generally more compatible with slightly older C++ projects like Catch2 2.2, and may not produce the `redundant-move` warning or treat warnings as errors by default in the same way newer compilers do. This change falls under environment setup to ensure a compatible compiler toolchain.",
