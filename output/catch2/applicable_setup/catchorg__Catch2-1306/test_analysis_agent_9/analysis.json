  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The `ctest -R \"ToStringWhich\"` command failed with the message \"No tests were found!!!\" (line 118). This indicates that CTest either did not discover any tests matching the provided regex pattern, or the tests defined in `projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringWhich.tests.cpp` are not registered as individual CTest entries for `ctest` to filter. While the \"SelfTest\" executable was built successfully, the target tests were not identified and executed.\n\nTo ensure the target test (`projects/SelfTest/UsageTests/ToStringWhich.tests.cpp`) is executed, modify the script to directly invoke the `SelfTest` executable generated during the build and use Catch2's internal filtering mechanism. This is a more robust way to target specific tests within a Catch2 project.\n\n**Action:**\n1.  Replace the line `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest -j $(nproc) -R \"ToStringWhich\"` with:\n    ```bash\n    ./SelfTest --rng-seed 0 --test-spec \"*ToStringWhich*\"\n    ```\n    *   `./SelfTest`: Executes the Catch2 test runner directly from the `Build` directory.\n    *   `--rng-seed 0`: This is a good practice for reproducible test runs in Catch2, disabling randomization.\n    *   `--test-spec \"*ToStringWhich*\"`: This command-line argument will filter Catch2 tests to only run those whose names or tags contain \"ToStringWhich\", which should correctly target the tests defined in `ToStringWhich.tests.cpp`.\n2.  The `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1` environment variable and `-j $(nproc)` argument are specific to `ctest` and are not applicable when running Catch2 executables directly. Their removal in the suggested command is intentional to fit Catch2's direct CLI usage.\n3.  Ensure the exit code `rc=$?` correctly captures the result of the `./SelfTest` execution.",
