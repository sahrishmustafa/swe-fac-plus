This is expected as Catch2 version 2.2, which is being used (commit 021fcee636), does not support the `--test-spec` flag; it was introduced in Catch2 v2.4.0.\n\nTo correctly filter tests by name/pattern in Catch2 v2.2, the pattern should be passed directly as a positional argument to the executable, without any specific flag.\n\n**Action:** Modify the `eval_script` by changing the test execution command from:\n`./SelfTest --rng-seed 0 --test-spec \"*ToStringWhich*\"`\nto:\n`./SelfTest --rng-seed 0 \"*ToStringWhich*\"`\n\nThis change will ensure that the wildcard pattern `*ToStringWhich*` is passed correctly to filter the tests from `ToStringWhich.tests.cpp`.",
