This indicates that the project's own CMake configuration or build system is aggressively re-enabling `-Werror`. To circumvent this, explicitly set the `CXXFLAGS` environment variable within the Dockerfile before the CMake configuration step. This provides another layer of forcing `-Wno-error` for the compiler. Add `ENV CXXFLAGS=\"-Wno-error\"` after the `git reset --hard` command and before `python3 scripts/generateSingleHeader.py` and the `cmake` configuration line.",

Although the Dockerfile attempts to address this, explicitly setting the `CXXFLAGS` environment variable for the build command in the eval script can help ensure the compiler always receives the `-Wno-error` flag. Add `export CXXFLAGS=\"-Wno-error\"` directly before the `cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)` command to provide this override.",
