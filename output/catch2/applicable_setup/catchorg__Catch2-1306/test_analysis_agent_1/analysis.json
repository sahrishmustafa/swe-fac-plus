This indicates that a warning is being treated as an error by the C++ compiler. To resolve this, modify the CMake configuration in the Dockerfile to explicitly disable warnings from being treated as errors. Add the flag `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error\"` to the `cmake` command in the `Dockerfile`. This will allow the project to compile successfully even with this specific warning. The modified CMake command should look like:\n`RUN cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_CPP14=1 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error\"`",
