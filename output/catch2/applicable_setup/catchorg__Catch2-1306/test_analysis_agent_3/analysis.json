  "guidance_for_write_dockerfile_agent": "The build failed with a C++ compilation error, specifically 'redundant move in return statement', because 'all warnings [are] being treated as errors'. Although `CMAKE_CXX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=FALSE` was set in the Dockerfile's cmake command, it appears to be insufficient or overridden. To resolve this, explicitly disable treating warnings as errors at the compiler level by adding `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Wno-error\"` to the `cmake -H. -BBuild` command in the Dockerfile. This should override any `-Werror` flags set by the project or default compiler behavior and allow the build to complete.",
  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The current evaluation script did not correctly capture the build failure. The `cmake --build Build` command failed (as indicated by the 'Error 1' and 'Error 2' messages in the log), but the script continued to execute `ctest`, which then reported 'No tests were found!!!' because the executable was not built. The `OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE` was incorrectly reported as `0`. To fix this, modify the line `cmake --build Build -j $(nproc)` to propagate the build failure by adding `|| exit 1`. This will ensure the script exits with an error code if the build fails, correctly signaling a problem.",
