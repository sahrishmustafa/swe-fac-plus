This is despite the build process successfully linking the `tests/SelfTest` executable (line 20), which is expected to contain the target tests. This suggests that while the test executable was built, CTest did not discover or correctly register these tests.\n\nTo resolve this, modify the `eval` script to directly execute the compiled test binary `/testbed/build/tests/SelfTest` instead of relying on `ctest` for discovery. This is a common pattern for running Catch2 tests.\n\nReplace the line:\n`CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ctest --test-dir build -C Release -j 2`\nwith:\n`./build/tests/SelfTest`\n\nEnsure that the exit code from this direct execution is captured and reported as `OMNIGRIL_EXIT_CODE=$rc`.\n\nAlso, consider testing the environment setup more thoroughly with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for more verbose output if there are further compilation or linking issues related to tests, although for now, `Release` is acceptable as the executable was built. The primary issue is test execution, not environment setup or compilation.",
